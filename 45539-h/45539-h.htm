<h1 class='c009'>THE COMPLEAT BACHELOR</h1>
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch01' class='c010'>I <br /> <br />SUGAR AND LEMON</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps, Rollo,” said my sister (Caroline
Butterfield, spinster), “you would
like to go on to your club, and call for
me in an hour or so. There will only be
women, I expect.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Carrie,” I replied, “your consideration
does you credit; but no company that you
may enter is too bad for me. I insist on
accompanying you. It is my first duty as
a brother.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Carrie laughed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I believe you like it, Rol,” she said.
“Molly Chatterton says Loring says you
never go to a club if you can have tea with
a married woman.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is the one reward of a blameless
reputation,” I replied; “but that Loring
Chatterton should say so is rank ingratitude,
considering his own ante-nuptial record.
Rank ingratitude.”</p>

<p class='c012'>We dismounted together at Millicent
Dixon’s door, and were admitted to the
hall. Carrie gave my necktie an attentive
little tug, slapped my cheek (Carrie is
justly proud of her middle-aged brother,
and likes to show him off to advantage),
and preceded me into Millie Dixon’s
drawing-room. Some half-dozen ladies
were engaged in the usual five-o’clock flirtation
with tea and cake, and contributing
to the feminine hum which didn’t subside
in the least as we entered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He <i>would</i> come, Millie,” said Caroline,
after a cross-over kiss on both cheeks,
“but you can lean him up in a corner and
give him some tea to keep him quiet.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This from my own flesh and blood!</p>

<p class='c012'>Millie Dixon gave me a laughing nod
over her shoulder, and busied herself preparing
the cup that should have the effect
Carrie suggested. I sat down, and composed
myself to listen to the restful chatter
that was supposed not to interest me.
Mrs. Loring Chatterton, at my side, was
rippling gently on the subject of a School of
Art Needlework Exhibition, while Carrie
and Mrs. Carmichael talked Marshall and
Snelgrove to Cicely Vicars and Mrs.
Julian Joyce. I have no disdain for ladies’
babble—it is quite as entertaining as starting-price
and stock-exchange gossip, and
much prettier. But I couldn’t get Chatterton’s
remark out of my mind.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Cream or lemon, Mr. Butterfield?”
called Miss Dixon from the other side of
the room.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, if you please,” I answered absently,
while Miss Dixon looked a deprecating
query as to when I <i>should</i> be sensible. I
roused, and turned to Mrs. Loring Chatterton.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where is Loring to-day?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, I don’t know,” she replied. “I
told him I shouldn’t want him this afternoon,
so he said he would count the dreary
hours till joy returned. I expect he went
to count them at some club.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Loring always was ardent,” I remarked,
looking meditatively into my cup. “I
seem to remember that kind of thing from
Loring before. Long before you knew him,
Mrs. Chatterton.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What do you mean, Mr. Butterfield?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nothing, my dear Mrs. Chatterton,” I
replied. “Nothing out of the way. But
you don’t suppose that Loring had the good
fortune to happen on the perfect gem without—what
shall I say?—preliminary prospecting?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Chatterton and I are old friends.
She laughed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you think you can make me inquisitive,
Mr. Butterfield? I know all
about that. Why, I made Loring tell
me every——”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was my turn to laugh.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then there is nothing more to say,” I
answered. “Loring is my friend—he has
claims upon me. He has, doubtless, given
himself quite away, and half his bachelor
friends into the bargain. I think I see
him doing it. Isn’t that a pretty gown
Carrie is wearing? I chose it for her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Loring told me a great deal,” said Mrs.
Chatterton musingly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The buttons are from her grandmother’s
wedding-gown.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And he was so clumsy and boyish,”
she continued.</p>

<p class='c012'>Words were superfluous. I smiled.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Anyway,” Mrs. Loring went on, “I
don’t think it fair. Men have half a dozen
flirtations before they are married their
wives know nothing about.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And women, Mrs. Chatterton?” I
asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“<i>Some</i> women, Mr. Butterfield, may not
be scrupulous. But——”</p>

<p class='c012'>The unfinished sentence was a <i>résume</i> of
female virtue since the days of Penelope.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What are you two so interested in?”
cried Mrs. Carmichael from a remote sofa.
I had just caught her eye.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Loring placed her hand beseechingly
on my sleeve, but I hardened my heart.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We were recalling the time, Mrs. Kit,”
I replied, “before your several husbands
were enticed from the liberty of bachelor
life; we were commenting on the change
in them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“<i>You</i> should be able to appreciate the
difference, Mr. Butterfield,” returned Mrs.
Carmichael. “You are just where they
left you years and years ago.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, ma’am,” I replied, “I have not been
able to bury my memory in the wedding-service,
nor forget my past in a honeymoon.
I am still as unregenerate as, say, Kit
Carmichael was before he met you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are a great deal worse,” returned
Mrs. Kit.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You refuse a very pretty compliment,
Mrs. Carmichael,” I replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, at Kit’s expense. It was you who
made Kit as bad as he was. He told me
so.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The perfidy of these married friends!
Rol Butterfield, you have no use for them
when they sacrifice you on their nuptial
altars. Their eyes lost their singleness
with their hearts, and your reputation has
gone for a kiss. Well, you have your revenge
on their wives, if you care to use it.</p>

<p class='c012'>The spark of righteous war was kindled
within me. I leaned forward, and spoke
my speech with icy distinctness.</p>

<p class='c012'>“So I am responsible for Carmichael’s
past, am I, Mrs. Kit? Listen to me. There
was not a more abandoned and desperately
wicked trio in London than Kit Carmichael—your
meek brother, Miss Dixon—and
Loring——”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Chatterton endeavoured to stop me
with a hot teaspoon laid on my hand, but
I still testified.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And Loring Chatterton. Not content
with steeping their own souls in infamy, they
must needs go afield, and corrupt the
spotless name of one—oh, Carrie, Carrie,
what your poor brother has suffered! And
now to be told in his old—his middle—age
that he did it all!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Kit and Cicely Vicars had put their
heads together, and were endeavouring to
put aside the damning testimony in mock
admiration of the dramatic skill with which
it was uttered. Cicely Vicars had best
be very careful. I was to be leaned up in
a corner and given tea, was I?</p>

<p class='c012'>“Doesn’t Mr. Butterfield look well with
the light behind him?” said Mrs. Vicars
with a pretty gesture of her hand. Mrs.
Vicars paints flowers, and asks her friends
what they would really like for wedding
presents.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mr. Butterfield may have the Light behind
him, Mrs. Vicars,” I replied, “but he
has no regrets for a misspent youth. Charlie
Vicars wasted his youth most shamefully.
Mornings in the park, with a young lady
in a pink frock—is that not so, Mrs. Loring?”</p>

<p class='c012'>I turned to her suddenly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It was a green frock,” said Mrs. Loring
thoughtlessly; then turned quite pink.
It was a pretty situation. Loring might
have treasured that blush. I was avenged.</p>

<p class='c012'>Millicent Dixon came to the rescue.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Carrie, dear,” she said, “you are the
only one who has any influence over that
irrepressible man. Do gag him for a few
minutes;” and passed over a plate of
gaufrettes, which Carrie brought to me.</p>

<p class='c012'>I held the plate to Mrs. Loring Chatterton,
who, a reminiscence of fun still in
her eyes, accepted the peace-offering with a
warning shake of her head.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mr. Butterfield,” she said, “you never
were anything but mischievous, and it’s
my opinion you never will be. Oh, I wish
I could get you off my hands. There are
plenty of nice girls. Look at Millie there,”
she whispered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mrs. Loring,” I replied, “once upon a
time there was a fox, who was caught in
a trap, and had his tail cut off. After
that——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah well, I suppose you know your
own mind. But, Mr. Butterfield”—she
leaned over, and spoke quite low—“I
believe you make out your young days—and
Loring’s—to have been much worse
than they were. Do you not, now?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Loring had a little beauty-spot on
her conscience which she thought was a
stain.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch02' class='c013'>II <br /> <br />A HYPOTHETICAL CASE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Carrie and I were placidly surveying,
from either end of my little dining-table,
the creditable wreck we had made of a
rather neat little dinner. Carrie never
disdains this hour of the animal, at whatever
table fortune shall place her; and
when she does me the honour to dine
with me, she generally pays me the compliment
of evident enjoyment. It is a
feature I admire in her.</p>

<p class='c012'>I was making leisurely coffee arrangements
with my latest bachelor acquisition,
a pretty little silver and spirit affair,
that did not necessitate rising from a comfortable
seat; while my sister purred in
soft content. I moved the shaded lamp
aside to see her better—Carrie is a very
presentable young woman; I thought her
arms decidedly pretty.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think, Rol,” she said, as I looked carefully
to the coffee, “I think—we will not
grace the theatre this evening. It’s such
a wet night, and I’m so comfy here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I could hear the rain without getting
up. It was a wet night; and she did look
comfy.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very well, my dear sister,” I replied.
“As you please. It will save me a sovereign,
unless you succeed in coaxing it out
of me during the evening, which I have no
doubt is your real motive.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, Rol, really I don’t want——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not enough, eh? Haven’t got it, my
dear—this is good coffee, Caroline,—I’m
really as poor as Hooley. There, that’s
right. <i>Kümmel avec, n’est ce pas</i>, my
dear?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Please. No, Rol, we’ll sit here and be
nice all the evening. I’ll bring my writing
in—may I?”</p>

<p class='c012'>I was only half convinced it wasn’t
money; she was after something. Carrie’s
writing is her one affectation, with which
exception she is as sane as would be expected
of my sister.</p>

<p class='c012'>I believe it was a modern comedy which
was then occupying the years of her youth,
and whose production was to be the crown
of her old age. She worked at it intermittently,
that is to say, when there were no
calls to receive or to be made, when she could
find nobody to take her to a theatre or a
garden-party, when there were no women
to gossip with, or men to fascinate—whenever,
in short, she felt dull. But of late
she had seemed to recover interest in it—had
recast it, she said.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Bring it in, by all means,” I replied,
“but bring a dictionary as well; I’m not
absolute in spelling.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thank you, Rollo.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Why the deuce was she so uncommonly
polite? She usually announced that she
was going to spend the evening with me in
much less considerate terms. I shook my
head apprehensively.</p>

<p class='c012'>When dinner was removed Carrie disappeared,
and presently re-entered with an
armful of comedy and a mouthful of quill
pens. She made a clean sweep of my desk
and settled herself with many quirks and
little graces before the recast masterpiece.
I gravely asked her permission to smoke,
and she, smiling at the superfluity of the
question, bowed a ceremonious assent; then
got down to business, and chewed a pink
knuckle in the stress of composition.</p>

<p class='c012'>I put my feet upon a chair, lighted a
cigar, and looked alternately at the fire and
at Caroline. She made my room appear
very comfortable, with her evening frock
and pretty airs. She was an excellent
housekeeper, and kept my half of our little
flat almost as dainty as her own. We got
along very cosily, Carrie and I—for a sister,
she behaved very well indeed. She could
have the sovereign if she wanted it; I only
hoped it was no worse.</p>

<p class='c012'>By and by Carrie looked up meditatively,
started on a fresh knuckle, and then turned
to me.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What do men talk about after dinner,
Rol, when the women have left?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>I looked at her curiously and smiled.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, Rollo,” she said, “I don’t mean—I
mean, what do they talk about?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh!” I replied, “what do they <i>really</i>
talk about, eh?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes. I want to put it in the play.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You want to put it in the play? Let
me see.” I considered a moment. “Well,
after the first grief at the loss of the ladies,
their hands go instinctively to their hair,
to feel how they have looked. If there is
a mirror handy they flock to it. They
then sit down, look wistfully at the empty
chairs, and fold their hands patiently, to
await the earliest moment that they may
rejoin their bereft partners.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t be absurd, Rol,” answered Carrie.
“I want to know. I’ve got a man here,
who is to talk after dinner. He’s in love
with a girl he’s been sitting next, and I
want him to say pretty things about her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Happy, happy innocence! dear simple
Carrie! Should I be the one to destroy so
sweet an illusion? Never!</p>

<p class='c012'>I was intensely amused, but I replied
thoughtfully:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I should think in the first place it
would depend a good deal on the man—and
the girl. What are they like?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He’s a soldier,” said Carrie, looking
timidly down at her manuscript. “That
is, he has not seen any active service, but
he’s simply thirsting to do some brave
deed that shall show her how he loves
her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” I said, much interested. “A
carpet knight; how old?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He’s about four-and-twenty, I believe;
and he’s not a carpet knight. He’s very
good, and clever, and noble. He’s supposed
to be dining at his married sister’s,
and has to entertain the men with brilliant
talk.”</p>

<p class='c012'>If I didn’t know that noble young soldier,
I would never look on daylight again!</p>

<p class='c012'>“Black hair?” I said.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” replied Carrie promptly. “That
is—I don’t know. I haven’t decided yet.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I leaned back in my chair to recover
from the shock. This, then, was what
made her so loving to her brother. This
was the “nice evening” we were to have.
She had a secret which pricked her conscience.
She was going to be nice to me
for the time remaining. I might have
known she didn’t visit Mrs. Loring Chatterton
for nothing. A soldier to run off
with my housekeeper! She had recast the
play with a vengeance; I was to play the
good brother’s part.</p>

<p class='c012'>I shut my eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, Rol?” said Carrie. She had evidently
not noticed my state. She didn’t
know I knew.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Let me think,” I replied, “let me
think.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I was not allowed to think; a tap at the
door roused me, and two visitors were announced.
In came Loring Chatterton, and
the young brother-in-law himself. I had to
admit he was a not unprepossessing young
warrior.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How do you do, Miss Butterfield?”
came simultaneously from my two guests,
while Carrie rose, putting aside her manuscript.
I greeted them from my chair.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am afraid we interrupt your writing,
Miss Butterfield,” said Loring, sitting down.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh no, Mr. Chatterton,” Caroline replied.
“As a matter of fact I was rather stuck
when you came in.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, Loring,” I interposed, “Carrie was
rather stuck when you came in. Perhaps
we shall be able to help her, eh, Bassishaw?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Delighted,” replied Bassishaw; “but
I’m afraid, do you know, that I haven’t
much of a head on me for that sort of thing,
Miss Butterfield.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Rollo——” began Carrie.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, he’ll do, Carrie,” I replied. “Caroline
wants to know, Bassishaw, what a
young man, good, clever, and—let me see—was
he noble, Carrie? Yes, I believe he
was noble, and—a brilliant talker”—(I had
him there)—“a brilliant talker, would say
after dinner about the girl he thought he
loved.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Carrie was helpless. I had not given
her away, and she did not dare to protest
for fear of doing so herself. She had a
secret—I also had a secret. I would keep
the case strictly hypothetical.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, Miss Butterfield,” began the hero
who was thirsting to do some brave deed,
“I’m hanged, do you know, if I know what
he’d say. He’d talk a lot of piffle, wouldn’t
he—oh, but he’s a brilliant sort of chap.
He’d—oh, hang it, Loring, what would he
say? I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I chuckled softly. I didn’t want to hear
Loring; I wanted to hear the brilliant
talker. It was for Carrie’s benefit.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But if he really loved her,” I said, “and
his eloquence came out in a torrent?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, I see. Well, I expect he’d say she
was a confounded nice girl—or something—pretty
and all that, you know—and he’d
row any chap who said she wasn’t; don’t
you think, eh? But why the deuce should
he say anything?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Bassishaw was coming out of it with
more credit than I thought. I laughed,
and even Carrie had to laugh too.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think,” said Chatterton, “that’s about
as much as he could say, unless he were an
ass. I can’t imagine his saying much if
you were there, Rollo.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” said Bassishaw. “You <i>are</i> a mischievous
sort of Johnny, you know, Butterfield.
You’re deuced hard on young chaps;
you guy them awfully, you know. I expect
you’ve forgotten all that.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus unconsciously, was Bassishaw revenged.
I was hard on young chaps. I
had forgotten, you know. I was an old
fossil, or something. But I had a sister,
deuced nice girl, pretty, and all that. You
have to keep in with Johnnies like that, you
know.</p>

<p class='c012'>One thing I must know. Did this plain-spoken
young man of the sword care for
Carrie? This was soon evident from his
conciliatory manner toward me. No one
ever goes out of the way to consider me
unless he wants something. Bassishaw was
most attentive.</p>

<p class='c012'>“By the way, Butterfield,” he said after
a while, “are you engaged for Tuesday
afternoon? Because if you’re not, do you
know, my folks are giving a sort of garden-party,
or something. There’ll be lots of
people of your sort”—(my sort!)—“coming—clever,
and all that, you know; I thought
you might care to come. I’ll get them to
ask you, if you like. And Miss Butterfield,
too; Chatterton here is coming, and he’ll
look after you, you know, Butterfield.
What do you say?”</p>

<p class='c012'>I turned to Carrie.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think we might go, Rol,” she said.
“I like to meet clever people.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I thought a moment.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know, Bassishaw,” I replied—“that
I care to meet people of—er—my sort,
much. But if Carrie cares to go, I’ll look
after her. It may be of use to her—in a
literary way. Thank you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I wouldn’t have missed that garden-party
for a good deal.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch03' class='c013'>III <br /> <br />A MILITARY MANŒUVRE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>I had feigned to change my mind several
times with regard to Bassishaw’s garden-party,
but Carrie had suddenly developed
accentuated ideas on the subject of engagement-keeping.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We promised, you know, Rol,” she said,
“and it would look so bad to run off. I
don’t suppose it will be much fun,” she
added candidly.</p>

<p class='c012'>She was mistaken. It would be great
fun.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the way thither I entertained her
blandly on the subject of unmarried life. I
pointed out to her the advantages of a brother
and sister living happily together, as, say,
in our own case. I argued on the holy bonds
of kinship, and congratulated her on having
a brother who would devote the whole of
his life to making her comfortable. How
happy we were!</p>

<p class='c012'>Carrie moved uneasily in her seat. She
endeavoured to change the subject. Her
conscience wrought within her—she was a
guilty traitor, and deceiving the kindest of
brothers. Had she been less in love, she
might have suspected something, as I continued
in the same strain; but such is not
the way of youth. Her arts might have
been transparent to me for months and
months, yet she would at last break the
great secret with most delicious gentleness,
in stammers and blushes, and I would show
a dramatic surprise and shock. We see
other people’s progress, but our own love
affairs are always unguessed.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a great relief to Carrie when we
arrived at the Bassishaws’. The strain was
getting embarrassing. A straight military
young figure had evidently been on the
look-out for our conveyance, for he made
several false starts, and almost supplanted
the more ceremonious reception due from
his mother. This little formality through,
he pounced on us at once.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How d’ye do, Miss Butterfield? Do,
Butterfield?” he said warmly. “So glad
you’ve come.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thank you,” I replied. “I was rather
afraid I’d have to let Carrie come alone,
but I managed to arrange it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>A shade of regret was visible in his
eyes, but he bore it nicely. He is “white,”
as Carmichael would have said.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course,” he said, “Miss Butterfield
would have been all right, you know, but
I’m glad you came too.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I believe he was. Saying so seemed to
make him so.</p>

<p class='c012'>We walked up the garden, I in the
middle. Carrie received an occasional bow,
but we didn’t know many people there.
This was young Bassishaw’s excuse for
conducting us personally, and he pointed
out various people as “men you ought to
know, you know, Butterfield.” I betrayed
no great desire for the acquaintanceship.
I was not to be shaken off.</p>

<p class='c012'>Bassishaw was piloting us into the most
frequented parts. This young man was
manœuvring, with more skill than I had
given him credit for, to drop me. Carrie
had my arm, and as Bassishaw stopped at
the various groups I made surer of it by a
little closing in of my elbow. He had the
advantage of a tactician’s knowledge, but
I had the larger experience. He led us
towards the base of operations, the refreshment
tent, where he calculated to play on
the natural interest I should take in the
commissariat department. He gave me a
hint of a private canteen—it was good
strategy, I was very thirsty—but I held
out. He showed a great desire to introduce
me to personages, but I replied to his big
guns with a harassing fire of conversational
small-arms. He really did very well, and
my respect for him increased. Personal
strategy was his line, but I held him in
the field of mental manœuvres.</p>

<p class='c012'>He had pointed out some snowy-whiskered
old general, and had held forth in
his redundant way on the fascinating personality
of the man. I made him a text
for an army discourse.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you know, Bassishaw,” I said, “I
cannot sufficiently admire you military
men. You are the outposts of a nation,
who make all that is happy and peaceful
at home possible. You sacrifice yourselves
on inaccessible Indian hills, you scorch
under African suns, while all you love is
left behind you in England. You do not
marry—that is, the true soldier thinks it
inconsistent with his duty,—and you leave
all you care for to fight the battles of a
less devoted society. It is self-sacrificing;
and when you return, it is to a bachelor’s
old age, like the general there.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, I don’t know, Butterfield,” he
replied. “Lots of our soldiers marry, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I could feel Carrie’s arm trembling on
mine. I continued:</p>

<p class='c012'>“That is another instance of their nobility.
It makes their duty all the harder. They
have to leave their wives, and worship
them only in the ideal sense. They see
them, perhaps, only once in ten years, unless
they have risen to responsible posts.
It is a great devotion.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But, Rol,” said Carrie timidly, “lots of
women are glad to go abroad with their
husbands, and—and nurse, and that kind
of thing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then,” I replied, “they but unnerve
the warrior in the hour of his trial. He
does not fight for his country, but for his
wife. No. It is the bachelor soldier who
has my veneration.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s all very well, you know, Butterfield,”
protested the bachelor soldier uneasily,
“but, confound it, it’s hard enough
without that. Hang it all,” he broke out,
“if you’ve got that fancy sort of thing in
your head, why didn’t you join the army
yourself? You’re a bachelor, you know,
and it would be a jolly lot easier for you
to be a hero than—the other poor beggars.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I smiled. “It is just as necessary that
the soldier should have worthy people to
defend,” I replied. “No, Bassishaw, the
soldier’s watchword is singleness. He is
as great a solitary as that other one, who
devotes his life to writing. The soldier
knows he is doing some good—the writer
takes the risk.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But writers often——” began Bassishaw.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And soldiers——” said Carrie at the
same time.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Both cut themselves off in a voluntary
abnegation,” I replied. “They scorn the
smaller comforts; the one worships his art,
the other his duty. Look at Loring and his
wife, there. They look happy, and comfortable,
and pretty; they have gentle, domestic
pleasures. But they have no conception
of the grandeur of duty. They do not know
the stern joys of the warrior, they——”</p>

<p class='c012'>I had been so rapt in my idea that for
the moment my guard was down. The
watchful foe took instant advantage of it.
Unseen by me, he had quietly beckoned to
Loring, who crossed over to us.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Rollo,” he said, “my wife wants to
speak to you a moment most particularly.
She is waiting there.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I was out-manœuvred—the ally had taken
me in the flank. I couldn’t resist. I looked
at them, and then at Mrs. Loring, who was
waiting, tapping her toe with her parasol.
There was no way out. I turned away,
and, looking over my shoulder, saw the triumphant
foe turn the corner of the greenhouse
into the shrubbery, a road of the third
class, impassable for artillery.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, Mrs. Loring,” I said, smarting
under my defeat; “I am glad to see you.
What do you want?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Mr. Butterfield,” she returned effusively,
“I’ve been wanting to speak to
you all the afternoon. Isn’t it a lovely day?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is a lovely day; a lovely day,” I replied.
“I have been greatly struck by the
beauty of the day.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is perfect,” she said, endeavouring
to gain time. “Oh, how nice it is to be
young, Mr. Butterfield!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mrs. Loring,” I answered severely, “did
you send for me to tell me it was a lovely
day, and that it was nice to be young?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course not,” she replied, much embarrassed.
“I wanted—I wanted to talk
to you. I wanted—oh, do help me, Loring.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Molly wanted to tell you, Rollo——”
began Chatterton.</p>

<p class='c012'>I silenced him with a peremptory wave
of the hand.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Molly wanted to tell me something I
didn’t know,” I replied. “Molly wanted
to tell me that I was blind and deaf and
stupid, and that I couldn’t see what was
under my nose. She wanted to tell me
of afternoon appointments at her house,
and Heaven knows what sort of carrying
on. She wanted——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, you shouldn’t tease them so,”
replied Mrs. Loring, illogical, after the
manner of women, but staunch.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Madam,” I said, “I am not so fatuous
as to suppose that if two young persons
intend to practise idolatry on one another,
my wisdom and experience will stop them.
But I have been plotted against, have been
told nothing; and I am entitled to get
what melancholy amusement I can out of
the affair. You have spoiled my entertainment.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I adjusted my hat to an angle suggestive
of rectitude, and bowed myself away. I
made for my hostess, and had myself presented
to the general.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You have a promising young strategist
in our young friend Bassishaw,” I remarked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“In what way?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He has turned the flank of a superior
force, and is in retreat with a hostage,” I
replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>When, half an hour afterwards, I again
encountered the victorious enemy, they
made straight for me. I received them
with dignity.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Rollo, dear,” began my sister, laying
her hand affectionately on my sleeve, and
coming very close to me, “we have something
to say to you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Her voice was almost a whisper.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” said Bassishaw. “You see it’s
this way, Butterfield, I’ve asked Caroline to
be my wife. I know it’s too bad not to
have let you into it, but, hang it all, you
don’t encourage a chap much, you know.
You’re so deuced quizzy, you know. And,
I say, Butterfield. That was all rot about
soldiers not marrying, now, wasn’t it? I
know you’re a good chap, Butterfield, and
you’ll let me have Carrie, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>I was afraid he was going to say I should
not lose a sister but gain a brother; but
he didn’t. My spirit was broken; I had
no dramatic surprise left in me. Carrie
looked up pleadingly, with a tiny little tear
in one eye.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s 'yes,’ isn’t it, Butterfield?” said
Bassishaw. “You’re the only one to ask,
you know. And if it isn’t 'yes,’ you
know——”</p>

<p class='c012'>Talented young man! He knew when
to press a yielding foe. I sighed, and
took an arm of each. I feebly tried to recover
my old authority, but they talked
laughingly across me, and I knew what
sort of glances were passing behind my
head. I was led captive to Chatterton and
his wife. Action was better than insight
after all.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch04' class='c013'>IV <br /> <br />A CHILDREN’S PARTY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>A good dinner in particular, and a comfortable
sense of solvency in general, had
thrown me into a half whimsical, half melancholy
musing, from which I was roused
by a small pair of hands placed over my
eyes from behind, and a challenge to
guess.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was not the least possibility of it
being any one other than it was, but I
guessed “Jack Wharton,” and had my
ears boxed. Jack Wharton is a large creature
with fat fingers, and more rings on
each of them than a Plantagenet sword has
coronets—a well-meaning, meritorious kind
of man, and my sister Carrie’s special aversion.</p>

<p class='c012'>Carrie sat on the arm of my chair, and
paid little feminine attentions to my hair,
which she tried to make the most of—there
is not so much of it as there once
was. A certain tendency to early harvest
in hair is a family trait, and I occasionally
subdue the arrogance of my sister’s youth
by reading to her from the health column
of some family paper.</p>

<p class='c012'>She patted down the last wisp, and
addressed me.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you know, Rol,” she said, “I have
an idea.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I leap for joy, my dear,” I replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>Carrie is used to me. She went on unheeding.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Suppose—suppose we give a children’s
party.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I looked at her in surprise. A children’s
party in my flat! What did she
mean?</p>

<p class='c012'>“Suppose we give a masked ball or a
grandmother’s tea?” I suggested.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh well, if you will be silly—”
Caroline said, sitting straight up, and
adjusting the lace frivolity on her wrists.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But who on earth are you going to ask
to a children’s party?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Rol,” she replied, “there are lots
and lots of children. There’s Alice Carmichael’s
nephew, Ted——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ted Carmichael is seventeen years old,”
I remarked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And Nellie Bassishaw,” she continued.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nellie Bassishaw is fifteen, and old-fashioned
at that,” I replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, you must have some one to take
charge of the children, you know, Rol.
But there are heaps and heaps of nice
children. There’s Molly Chatterton, and
little Chris Carmichael, and lots of others.
I do think it would be fun.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I daresay it would,” I replied. “And
yourself and young Bassishaw would look
after them and amuse them, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, Arthur says he’ll come and help,”
she answered. I had evidently not been
the first one to be considered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And Arthur will bring half a dozen
young Bassishaws, younger than Nellie?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, yes, I expect he will. Why not?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And has Arthur ordered a magic-lantern?”
I asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not yet,” replied Carrie. “That is, he
<i>did</i> suggest a magic-lantern—children like
magic-lanterns, you know, Rol.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I was aware of it—other people than
children like magic-lanterns. I leaned back
and sighed; it was apparently all arranged.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And what date did you say you had
decided on?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The 17th,” replied my dutiful sister;
“that is, if you’ll be a good brother, and
let us use your rooms, Rol.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, anything you like,” I answered resignedly.
“I’ll clear out to the club and
you can do as you please. Only, mind you,”
I added, “I insist that there shall be children.
I will not be turned out of my rooms
for you and Bassishaw and all the Nellies
and Teds of your acquaintance to play any
magic-lantern racket.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, you dear brother!” cried Carrie,
blowing a kiss down the back of my collar.
“But you mustn’t go out, Rol. We shall
want you to help, you know. You
can——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Manage the gas, perhaps?” I suggested.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, the magic-lantern man will do that,”
she replied, laughing. “You can call the
forfeits—you used to know a lot of forfeits,
Rol—and pull crackers and things.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And have sprawling youngsters climbing
my back, and nurse them when they
get cross, I thought. But it was of no
use demurring before a determined young
sister. I must make the best of it.</p>

<p class='c012'>I was given due notice on the 16th, and
cleared my papers away. At Carrie’s
suggestion I also took down a print or two—children
were so quick at noticing things,
she said. Then I had the satisfaction of
seeing a Christmas-tree placed in the corner
devoted to my armchair, and of being able
to look forward to a week or two of occasional
pine-needles and grease-spots from
toy candles whenever I wanted to read.
A hairy man also came with a tool-bag,
which he threw on my dining-table, and
proceeded to make what seemed to me a
radical alteration in my gas system, trailing
flexible tubes across the floor, over
which I scarcely dared to step. I took my
hat and fled, leaving Carrie to do as seemed
good to her.</p>

<p class='c012'>Carrie had made me promise to assist,
and at five o’clock we were at the top of
the stairs receiving our young guests.
Arthur Bassishaw was there, of course—he
had been about for the last two days, and
had really, Carrie said, been invaluable.
Every few minutes a nursemaid arrived
with some pink-legged, fluffy little lump,
muffled up to its bright eyes. Young Ted
Carmichael brought my little friend Chris,
who clasped my knees and demanded that
I should be a dragon on the spot. Miss
Nellie Bassishaw came with half a dozen
little Bassishaws, casting a glance at Master
Ted that made that young gentleman nervous
about his gloves. Altogether by six
o’clock some twenty small people were sitting
round Carrie’s table, with an attendant
maid or two tall behind them, and the noise
was just beginning.</p>

<p class='c012'>Carrie, to do her justice, ordered young
Bassishaw about as if he were her own
brother, and he assisted with piled-up plates
and staggering jellies in the most creditable
manner. Master Ted Carmichael, however,
was evidently divided in mind as to
whether he should consider himself purely
a guest, or whether his age qualified him
for attendance on the kids, a perplexity in
which his palpable devotion to Nellie did
not help him much. Nellie was difficult to
woo that evening, and was playing off a
smaller schoolboy on her half-grown-up
admirer in a way that I liked immensely.
She has the germs of mischief in her, and
is pretty into the bargain. Ted, therefore,
moved in a state of unrest—now helping in
ministering to younger needs, and now resuming
his seat helplessly. There was a
speck of something in my memory that
made me feel for Ted.</p>

<p class='c012'>The noise increased, and by the time
Master Chris—a most depraved child—had
thrust a handful of raisin-stalks and broken
biscuits down the neck of the lady of five
whom he had taken in, children were romping
here and there, regardless of whispering
nurses who reminded them they were
still at table. They were swept into another
room by Carrie, with stamping of
sturdy legs and pulling of crackers. Ted
tried to remain behind to be near his disdainful
lady, but I brought him along. I
was willing to help him.</p>

<p class='c012'>I engaged Master Ted in conversation.
The children, I said, would soon be playing
games, and then we men would have a few
minutes to ourselves—perhaps time for a
cigar. He stiffened up in pleased pride,
and the front of his first dress-suit expanded.
He <i>was</i> grown up, then. He ventured the
remark that kids were awful slow, but they
had to be amused, he expected.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Slow, do you think, Ted?” I asked.
“Why, I find them most interesting. Look
at Miss Nellie there.” (She had just come
in.) “She looks almost grown up, but any
one can see she’s the biggest child of the
lot. Look at her with little Molly Chatterton—she
thinks she’s got a doll. Ah, Ted,
girls like that are at a very awkward age.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They <i>are</i> awkward,” Ted admitted.
“But Nellie, you know—Nellie’s not so
very—she was fifteen last—she’s almost—oh,
hang it, let’s go out for a smoke.”</p>

<p class='c012'>We made for the balcony.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Have a cigarette, Mr. Butterfield?” said
Ted, proffering a small silver case.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thanks,” I replied. “I think I’ll have
a cigar. Won’t you have one of these?
They’re very mild.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Ted looked doubtfully at it, and shook
his head.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, thanks,” he said; “I don’t often
smoke cigars. I’m very fond of a pipe now
and then—after breakfast, you know; but
cigars are a little too much for me. Light?”</p>

<p class='c012'>He held me a light, and puffed elegantly
at his cigarette. Then continued thoughtfully:</p>

<p class='c012'>“The worst of women is,” he said, “they
seem to grow up so awfully quick, you
know. Why, Nellie Bassishaw there, you
know—we used to be rather flames when
we were young. A year or two since, that
is. We’re not so very old yet, you know,
Mr. Butterfield,” he added, with a slightly
conscious laugh.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Call me Butterfield,” I said softly and
encouragingly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t mind saying,” he continued, “I
was awfully stuck a while back. I used to
walk round the house at nights, you
know—darned silly, of course—and she
used to drop me notes from her bedroom
window. Of course you won’t say a word
to any of the men, but at one time she
wanted me to elope.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Indeed!” I said. “You surprise me.
In that case I have greatly misjudged her.
She is not so young as I thought she was.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, she’s not really, Butterfield,” he
said eagerly. “She’s awfully clever and
grown up, and all that—that is, she was
when we were so thick. Some time ago,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I nodded. I didn’t want to interrupt
him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And she’s going to have her hair up
next birthday,” he went on, “and then she’ll
be quite grown up. I’m a bit sorry it’s
all off.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He threw down the end of his cigarette,
and looked round at the balcony window.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” I said, “it isn’t time for the magic-lantern
yet. Half an hour or so. And
you’re almost sorry it’s all off?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, yes, in some ways,” he replied.
“Of course, I get about more than she does,
you know. Men do see more life than
girls, don’t they, Butterfield? I went to a
dance the other week, and of course Nellie
can’t go to dances yet. But the men were
another set, you know, and the women—well,
it’s not much fun sitting out in a
conservatory with strange women, is it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>I reserved my opinion on the point, and
he went on. He got very confidential, and
by the time he had got through another
cigarette he had my views as to whether
it was possible to keep a surreptitious wife
at Eton, whither he was to return shortly.
I rather took to Master Ted, and decided
that Carrie and Bassishaw should not have
<i>all</i> the fun out of the magic-lantern. I
would willingly have prolonged the talk,
but Ted was glancing nervously at the
window, and thought we really should go
in—the youngsters would need looking
after.</p>

<p class='c012'>We went in, in time to catch them playing
some game with a closed door and a
piece of mistletoe. I saw no necessity for
Carrie and Arthur Bassishaw joining in,
but join in they did, while Miss Nellie
looked intelligently patronising. Ted was
right—women did grow up quickly. As I
took a seat beside her I heard Ted whisper
to Carrie that her brother was a brick.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I hope you are having a good time,
Nellie?” I said.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nellie tossed her curls.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course, real dances are more in your
line,” I continued, “but you can spare an
evening for the children now and then.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Nellie bit her lip; she felt the point
keenly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t go to dances, Mr. Butterfield,”
she said stiffly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No?” I inquired blandly. “Well,
some people <i>are</i> prejudiced against dancing.
But I see no wrong in it myself. Do you
regard dancing as frivolous?”</p>

<p class='c012'>She had to make the humiliating confession.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know anything about it,” replied
Nellie, turning half away. “I am not allowed
to go to dances.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dear me!” I said; “motives of health,
doubtless?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, I’m not considered old enough.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh!” I said, in the tone of one who
feels he has pushed his inquiries too far.
“That is a pity. There is such fun at
dances—sitting out, you know, and such
things. You can’t have such fun anywhere
else.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Nellie looked a defiant “Couldn’t she,
though,” and I considered my young friend
Ted’s affair as good as arranged. I heard
her whisper to Bassishaw later that Mr.
Butterfield was a beast.</p>

<p class='c012'>Carrie came bustling up to ask me to
help in the preparations for the magic-lantern;
and shortly afterwards the light
was down, and the great white circle shifting
and quivering on the sheet, to the
whispering anticipation of eager children.
When, a few minutes later, I had taken Chris
Carmichael on my knee, and the pictures
had begun, certain quiet indications from
the back told me that Master Ted was having
a good time. I couldn’t see the young
monkeys at it, but I divined from the brooding
peace in that direction that they were
hand in hand. Hand in hand at least.</p>

<p class='c012'>An hour later the place was quiet once
more, and only Carrie, Bassishaw, and myself
were left, gathered round the cold
magic-lantern. I looked at it and shook
my head. I had to do it three times before
they noticed me.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is it now, Rol?” said Carrie.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sixteen next birthday,” I said to myself.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What <i>are</i> you talking about?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Used to drop him notes from her bedroom
window,” I mused.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, do shake him, Arthur.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Arthur shook me. I looked severely
at them both.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I suppose you know what you’ve
done,” I said, “you and your magic-lantern?”</p>

<p class='c012'>They commenced a look of innocence, but
I quelled them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If there is an elopement at your house
shortly, Bassishaw,” I said, “you can thank
this children’s party. Don’t pretend you
didn’t see them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m afraid, Butterfield, do you know,
that they are mischievous young beggars,”
replied Bassishaw; “but it’s not our fault.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not your fault!” I said, with rather a
touch of scorn, I think, in my voice; “not
your fault! You bring overcharged adolescence
together—you know the moral laxity
of sixteen—you know the latent depravity
of female sixteen especially—you provide
them with a handy magic-lantern and every
convenience—and it’s not your fault!
Well, I did my best to dissuade you; you
have only yourselves to thank. I wash my
hands of all consequences. Don’t blame
me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It pleased me to throw the responsibility
on someone else.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch05' class='c013'>V <br /> <br />THE IDEAL IN PERIL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The Fainéant Club was going to the
devil, which was unnecessary, considering
the state of the weather. There was nobody
about—including Wentworth Boyle.
The magazines were uncut—cutting meant
energy. The tape machine ticked out
nothing but cricket scores, in which I am
not interested. A waiter was sleeping in
a chair in a remote corner, the only suggestion
of coolness about the place. There
was absolutely nothing to do. It was too
hot to swear.</p>

<p class='c012'>I went to the window and looked out.
Piccadilly was a glaring Sahara. The rows
of horses across the way were limp as
chewed string, and lived for nothing but
the next water-cart that should pass and
drench their burning hocks. The trees
bore spiritlessly their burden of dust; and
the only energetic thing in sight was an
impervious newsboy crying the fatalities of
the heat-wave—a Song of Degrees.</p>

<p class='c012'>I was in a fermenting state of discontent.
The season had only just begun, and
there were at least six weeks of this to look
forward to—six weeks of hot, breathless
theatres, and daily martyrdoms on the
Row. The season was confounded rot. I
had half a mind to throw the whole thing
up. I went to the writing-table, wrote a
complaint to the committee on the iced
drinks, murmured the prayer for rain, and
returned to the window.</p>

<p class='c012'>Why did the women look so cool when
the men were in such a state of collapse?
Millicent Dixon had just driven past, looking
as fresh as a buttercup. I saw Millie
Dixon twice a week on an average, and
she always did look fresh. Yet she must
be eight-and-twenty.</p>

<p class='c012'>I determined to walk, if I could do so
without risking a sunstroke. The first
parasol of my acquaintance that passed
should be my refuge, provided the bearer
were not too stout. I am stoutish myself.</p>

<p class='c012'>A white gown was tripping—tripping!—towards
the club window, which, from a
certain trick of carriage, should belong to
Mrs. Loring Chatterton. I calculated my
time carefully, and stepped from the club
awning to the shelter of the sunshade.
Mrs. Loring is slight.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My dear Mr. Butterfield, how do you
do?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thank you, my dear lady,” I replied;
“with a little basting I shall do to a
turn.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! isn’t it?” she said. “I never
knew such heat in May. You must feel it
terribly, Mr. Butterfield.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Now, I am not so stout as all that.
Thirteen four, for a bachelor approaching
forty, and of personable height, is no extravagant
riot of flesh.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I admit to a certain warmth,” I replied;
“but when your own, permit me to say,
somewhat meagre presence has ripened to a
more generous noontide, perhaps <i>you</i> will
resent any ostentatious sympathy on the
subject.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Loring laughed. She always refused
to take my dignity seriously. To
her I am not Rollo Butterfield, LL.D.
(ceased to practise), but Mr. Butterfield,
who may be allowed to see the children in
bed, should he wish it, and who is sacrificed
on the altar of intimacy to take in
to dinner nervous schoolgirls, and act as
escort and general convenience in shopping
expeditions.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well,” said Mrs. Loring, “I don’t
think you ought to mind at your time of
life. Let me see, how much older than
Loring are you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mrs. Loring Chatterton, perhaps you
prefer to walk to Wilton Place alone?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It <i>must</i> be rather hard on you,” said
this incorrigible lady, laughing.</p>

<p class='c012'>I looked at the sunshade and at the glare
that shone mercilessly on my patent
leathers. Decision of action was never my
strong point, and the firmest principles
will soften at ninety-two in the shade. I
capitulated. Compromise beneath a parasol
was better than dignity in the sun.</p>

<p class='c012'>We walked along. By the exercise of
much ingenuity in mapping out a track
that should consist of the maximum of
shade, by the strategic use of large vans
and the skirting of a person with a huge
umbrella, whose shadow was as that of a
great rock in a thirsty land, we arrived at
Wilton Place, and, in response to Mrs.
Loring’s invitation to come and have tea,
I followed her in.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Loring’s drawing-room was cool as
a cloister. I foundered on to a sofa and
closed my eyes, while my hostess, as a last
impertinence, vapourised me in passing
with a tiny scent fountain, and left me in
a luxury of dim light.</p>

<p class='c012'>Such a retreat, at my time of life, was
very soothing. My meridian was pretty
near the full, and I had a right to a drowsy
siesta before facing again the afternoon
glow whose level rays would decline to
the long evening. I lazily watched a fly
that was spinning a soft drone in the twilighted
room, and blinked through my
half-closed eyes at the few white splashes
of sunlight on the floor, vivid in the subdued
tone. Bowls of flowers cooled the
air with perfume, and the Genius of Rest
brooded over the place. The afternoon
with its business would come, no doubt;
but for the present this was my oasis.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Loring reappeared in a tea-gown
whose gossamer frothed daintily about her
neck. She looked the pink of freshness—and
yet she was within three years of
thirty. I took a kind of pleasure in the
thought. Loring was a lucky man.</p>

<p class='c012'>A tray was brought in, and this attentive
lady fluttered round the little silver urn,
and ministered to my <i>paresse</i> with tea and
lemon. I grew humorously melancholy,
and lapsed into gentle vistas of reminiscence.
I believe I sighed.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Loring mentally referred the sigh
to corpulence, for she came over with tea,
and said, “There, poor man. That will
cool you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I half rose from my reclining posture,
and shook my head as I took the cup.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, madam,” I said, “tea-leaves cannot
allay the dust of memory. I sigh for what
once was, for what might have been now.
I sigh for Ten Years Back. Do you ever
sigh for Ten Years Back?”</p>

<p class='c012'>From the puzzled way in which she
looked at me, she evidently did not.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ten years back,” I continued, “you
and I were yet young.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She tried to look wrinkled.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ten years back you were interested in
painting, and visited the National Gallery.
Millie Dixon was also interested in painting
and also visited the National Gallery.
Loring Chatterton didn’t give a hang
for painting, yet he dragged me round
to the National Gallery. I paid the sixpences.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Anyway you were always glad enough
to see Millie Dixon; you didn’t do it out
of pure self-sacrifice.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The National Gallery,” I continued,
not heeding the interruption, “is one of the
great storehouses of the world’s art. It is
the pride of a great nation. <i>I</i> went there
for purposes of study; but how did <i>you</i>
profit by it? You used it for rubbing
shoulders and squeezing hands.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know how you profited by it,” said
Mrs. Loring, laughing. “You used to
study the water-colours down-stairs, and you
got locked in one day. Millie Dixon, by
the way, got locked in too.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Millie Dixon always <i>had</i> foresight,” I
said musingly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But you never painted, and Millie Dixon
did.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“In spite of your insinuation, Mrs. Loring,
I never ascertained that. Her complexion——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then you ought to have done. Here
are you two still hanging on in the same
position as ten years ago. <i>I</i> gave Millicent
a month if she knew her business. Loring
and I didn’t take so long. I am disappointed
in you. I’m sure it’s not Millie’s fault.”</p>

<p class='c012'>That was hardly fair. Millie had never
thrown herself at me.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If you’d made love to Millicent,” she
went on, “you’d not have been a lonely
fat old bachelor, living in a horrid flat, and
wasting your time at clubs and race meetings.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mrs. Loring Chatterton,” I replied, “if
I’d made love to Millicent I should have
been just as—mature of outline, and should
still have been a bachelor. It is my gift.
I was born a bachelor. I should have
said, 'Miss Dixon, if you love me, let me
remain a bachelor.’ She would have said,
'As a bachelor you first loved me; be
always my own bachelor.’ It is, alas! my
single talent. I was made for singleness.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Rubbish! You know you like Millicent.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dear madam, I like all ladies—as a
garden of flowers, yet I cannot bring myself
to pluck one.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then why do you sigh for ten years
back?”</p>

<p class='c012'>That is the worst of women—they have a
way of being suddenly logical when no one
expects it of them. Mrs. Loring is a charming
woman, but I must be careful. One or
two lapses into sentiment like this, and she
will have me married to Miss Dixon before
I know where I am. But my weakness
was over. I pulled myself together.</p>

<p class='c012'>A burning white spot of sunshine had
been slowly crossing the floor in my direction,
had mounted the sofa, and was
threatening to disturb my repose. It
brought back the hot streets and the stifling
club, and was invading my sanctuary
with vivid glare. I was moving along out
of its way when a bell rang.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! and the tea’s cold!” said Mrs.
Loring, with the first thought of a hostess.
“I’ll have to get some more in.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Miss Millicent Dixon entered unannounced.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My Dear Molly,” cried Miss Dixon, “if
you love me, give me some tea. How
do you do, Mr. Butterfield? Do you know,
Moll, I have been rushing about for two mortal
hours trying to find a wedding present
for Madge Beaumont, and I haven’t got
one! Do help me—Mr. Butterfield——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, don’t ask him,” Mrs. Loring struck
in; “Mr. Butterfield’s been getting sentimental.
Between ourselves, Millie, he
came dangerously near to a lucid interval.
He’s been sighing over a misspent life,
and wishing he were years younger.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is it announced yet, Mr. Butterfield?”
inquired Millicent mischievously. “Who
is she?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Promise to tell Millie before any one
else, Mr. Butterfield,” said Mrs. Loring.</p>

<p class='c012'>The machinating married woman! No
bachelor is safe with her. I said nothing.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then it is true!” said Miss Dixon,
“and I shall need two wedding presents.
Mr. Butterfield, the unassailable bachelor!
I shall give you <i>Paradise Lost</i>, Mr. Butterfield.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ladies,” I answered, “you are unfair.
You catch me in a weak moment, suffering
from sunstroke, and accuse me of good resolutions.
Does my previous bad character
go for nothing? May I not have a half-hour’s
weakness without hearing of it
again? It is my first offence. Oh, how
difficult is the true Bachelor Ideal!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then you are not engaged, Mr. Butterfield?”
said Millicent.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not to my knowledge, Miss Dixon. I
admit to a certain wavering. If it comes
again I will take you into my confidence;
in the meantime we will discuss Miss Beaumont’s
wedding present.”</p>

<p class='c012'>We went into committee on the subject.
I was still the Compleat Bachelor.</p>

<p class='c012'>But I had presentiments.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch06' class='c013'>VI <br /> <br />A CORNER IN TREACLE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>I could not help smiling as I rang Mrs.
Kit Carmichael’s bell. It wanted a good
hour to calling time, and I was sure to
arrive in that embarrassing period of the
afternoon when morning attire is being exchanged
for the tea-gown, and the indiscreet
visitor is left to meditate on the hollowness
of social obligations in an empty
drawing-room. It is an hour I take a peculiar
delight in. I like to see the piano
before Schubert’s songs have replaced the
thumbed exercise-book, and to divine midday
practisings, scarcely over, by young
ladies lanky in stocking, with surreptitious
chewing-gum in their pockets. It has still
the charm that “going behind” had for me
in my early theatrical days.</p>

<p class='c012'>I had made some masculine pretext for
leaving Carrie behind, and she was to follow
later. I had a small reason of my own
for wishing to see Mrs. Kit alone.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Kit’s maid admitted me. That
young person always seems inclined to
laugh when she sees me. I swear I have
never encouraged her.</p>

<p class='c012'>The drawing-room door was opened to
me, but I walked past it, beckoned by a
distant sound of childish romping, and a
young mother’s call of “Come here, Chris.”
I made all the noise in my approach that
pretended stealth demanded; I am delicate
in my freedom.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now, that is a part that needs a nice
discrimination in the true performing of it.
Intimacy has no severer test. Show me
the indiscreet bachelor friend whose title
falls short, be it only by a syllable, of the
full warranty, and I will show you a man
who shall wait for invitations, and to whom
the fiery sword of “not at home” shall be
displayed. The young wife in particular
is apt to be touchy.</p>

<p class='c012'>My approach had been heard, and a subdued
scuffling subsided as I entered the
half-open nursery door. Mrs. Kit had a
maid, and had at one time kept a nurse;
but the nurse had gracefully relinquished
the engagement on finding she had <i>two</i>
children in charge, the grown-up one
scarcely more manageable than the chubby
little imp who bore his father’s name.
Consequently, Master Christopher occupied
a good deal of his mother’s time, and was
in a fair way for being spoiled.</p>

<p class='c012'>This young gentleman of four hailed me
with a shout, and childish glee in his scantiness
of garment; while his mother, rosy
and bright with romping, did her best to
look crossly on my intrusion. Mrs. Carmichael
always keeps up an appearance of
formality, even with me.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mr. Butterfield, how dare you come
into my nursery!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mrs. Carmichael,” I replied, “I came to
have a talk with your son in the matter of a
certain giant in whom we are both interested.
Perhaps you yourself would care——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Chris shall not hear any story till he
has his pinafore on. It is as well you are
a bachelor, Mr. Butterfield. You would
spoil the best child in the world.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Unless I am mistaken, Mrs. Kit,” I answered,
“you yourself were playing the part
of a bear when I entered. Does one hunt
bears without a pinafore?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am his mother, and have to amuse
him—judiciously!” returned Mrs. Carmichael.
“You don’t know what a responsibility
children are, Mr. Butterfield.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I appreciate your feelings, madam,” I
replied. “I remember in my youth I kept
white mice. Now, white mice——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“White fiddlesticks,” said Mrs. Kit. “A
bachelor has absolutely no idea of what
trouble children are. They take the whole
of your time—they are constantly to be
watched—you never know what mischief
they are up to.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I kept <i>four</i> white mice, Mrs. Carmichael,
with power to add. You have only one——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, but Chris <i>is</i> so mischievous! He’s
so full of spirits. Scarcely an hour since
he <i>nearly</i> broke his neck trying to climb a
handrail, under the impression it was a
beanstalk—that was one of <i>your</i> stories,
Mr. Butterfield,—and last night he managed
to get Simple Simon into his prayers.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I shook my head.</p>

<p class='c012'>“An inherited irreligious tendency,” I
replied. “He’s probably got that from his
father. I remember Kit——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Rubbish! It’s just pure animal spirits.
Chris is getting so big and strong—<i>and</i>
noisy,” she added, as Chris broke away with
the shout of pagan infancy.</p>

<p class='c012'>“In that case, Mrs. Carmichael,” I answered,
“a reducing diet of cinder-tea, judiciously
administered——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Cinder-tea? What do <i>you</i> know about
cinder-tea?—Chris, put your arm through
here—a bachelor talking about cinder-tea!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The arrogance of these young married
ladies! They are all alike. You may have
seen scores of such pretty innocents installed
in their first establishments. You may
have known their existences from the time
they played peg-top with their brothers to
their perky airs over their first long frocks.
You may have given them away amid rice
and slippers at the rate of two a year, when
their bridal blushes almost made your
task superfluous. You may have known
them from teething-ring to trousseau, from
measles to marriage; and yet in the first wonder
of a new baby life you will be told that
you are an ignorant old bachelor, and that
you know nothing of household affairs!</p>

<p class='c012'>But I was not disposed to take any such
talk from Mrs. Kit Carmichael. I was too
old a friend of Carmichael’s, and could
always make her tingle with curiosity by
an artful hint of pre-nuptial reminiscence.
Besides which, she herself was too much in
my power. Distinctly, I had a right to
rebuke her. I leaned back, and questioned
her with forensic severity.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mrs. Carmichael,” I said, “you are
young, but that is no excuse for ingratitude.
Five years ago my advice was not superfluous.
Whose experience was it selected
you this little house, when Kit’s mind was
too full of love to distinguish such details
as sanitary arrangements?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I believe you gave some advice on the
subject, Mr. Butterfield,” she retorted, “and
we had workmen about the place for six
months.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I waived the thanklessness of the last
phrase, and continued with dignity.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who put you through an exhaustive
course of salads, Mrs. Carmichael?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, you <i>were</i> rather useful in the
matter of salads,” she admitted reluctantly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who gave you lessons in the refinements
of black coffee?” I continued, warming
in a righteous cause.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My coffee was not bad,” Mrs. Kit returned,
on her defence.</p>

<p class='c012'>I magnanimously put aside criticism of her
coffee, and went on with a wave of my hand.</p>

<p class='c012'>“To whom did you come for counsel on
distemper and wall decoration and tapestry
hanging? Who told you to cast on at the
bottom in mending stocking knees? Who
explained to you the principle of the chimney
draught, the law of ventilation, and the
mechanics of the picture-cord? Answer
me, Mrs. Carmichael.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She combed Master Chris’s hair vigorously
and made no response. I saw the victory
of a just rebuke within my grasp. I
made one more thrust.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And, finally, Mrs. Carmichael, have you
made the treacle puffs you promised for my
next visit?”</p>

<p class='c012'>She yielded.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, I am <i>so</i> sorry, Mr. Butterfield, but
they were a failure. I put them into the
oven, and all the treacle ran, and made, oh,
such a mess!”</p>

<p class='c012'>I leaned back with the magnanimity of
a conqueror, and in that moment lost the
battle. Carrie stood in the doorway.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Treacle puffs, Rollo!” she said. “Of
course they run if you forget the bread
crumbs. I told you that!”</p>

<p class='c012'>I was betrayed by her I called sister!
A light came into Mrs. Kit’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Did <i>you</i> give him those recipes, Carrie?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of <i>course</i> I did, Alice, and told him to
be <i>sure</i> to tell you about the bread crumbs.
And he <i>didn’t</i>! Oh, Rollo”—she turned
to me—“and you asked me if they would
be sure to run <i>without</i> the bread crumbs!”</p>

<p class='c012'>I was lost. Mrs. Carmichael rose, and
put aside the brush and comb.</p>

<p class='c012'>“So, Mr. Butterfield,” she said. “I
begin to see. You laid a trap for me. You
got Caroline to coach you in things before
coming to see me, and edited the recipes!
Let me remember. You told me, did you not,
that brown sugar improved poached eggs?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mrs. Carmichael——” I began. She
silenced me with a gesture.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You advised me, did you not, that
maccaroni should be kept in a dark place
for fear it should sprout?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That, Mrs. Carmichael, was on the
authority of the <i>Times</i>. You surely——”</p>

<p class='c012'>Again the peremptory finger reduced me
to dumbness.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And you stepped in after all my blunders,
and airily set me right! Mr. Butterfield,
you are an unspeakable deception!”</p>

<p class='c012'>That was my thanks. Carrie and I might
conspire to do good by stealth—I might go
out of my way to gather hints on pastry—and
because, forsooth, this woman’s execution
was not equal to the brilliance of the
idea, I was to be branded as a fraud! The
brown sugar was an original notion; and
if, forsooth, like the <i>Great Eastern</i>, it
turned out unmanageable in practice, that
did not detract from the boldness of the
conception. Women are so conservative;
they lack the true inventor’s spirit.</p>

<p class='c012'>I looked helplessly round the room. I
was overpowered at the ease with which
people will impute to one a base motive
rather than go out of the beaten track to
find a good one. How they give themselves
away!</p>

<p class='c012'>I turned and apostrophised Master
Christopher.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My poor, unwitting little boy! For
you, too, the time shall come when ingratitude
shall be your portion. You are a
bachelor yourself—you drink cinder-tea, but
the day shall arrive when you shall be told
you know less about it than the hand that
pours it out. Play while you can. Your
least word is heeded now; but afterwards
you shall cry wisdom in the nursery and
shall not be regarded.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Chris saw somehow that he was the
subject of remark, and now, trimly toileted
and elaborately combed, was ready for a
story grim in giant and spiced with goblin.
His mother, laughing at my apostrophe,
made a chubby fleshy fold in the childish
cheek that was pressed against her own,
and looked at me in a way that admitted
my capacity in fairy lore, if it discounted
my more practical qualifications.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, Chris,” she said, “Mr. Butterfield
is going to tell you just a short story, and
I’m going to receive my callers. Don’t be
long, Mr. Butterfield. Come, Caroline.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She vanished, and I entered the magic
land of giants.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch07' class='c013'>VII <br /> <br />THREE’S COMPANY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>I had been told nothing about it, but I
would have wagered my boot-trees that
Carrie and Bassishaw had had a tiff. In
the first place, Carrie had invited me to accompany
them to the opera when she knew
that my acceptance was possible, which was
contrary to her usual practice. My presence
on such occasions had of late been
not indispensable; and these young people
had gone about together with an aggressive
air of sufficiency in each other’s company
that had insulated them from my attentions
and led me to muse on the thanklessness
of youth.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are you going out with Arthur this
evening, my dear?” I had asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, yes, Rollo,” she had replied diffidently,
“Arthur particularly wanted to
take me to St. James’s Hall.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is a refining entertainment. I haven’t
heard Moore and Burgess for a long time.
I think I’ll come with you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>My sister evaded the main point, and
countered on the inessential.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s not Moore and Burgess,” she replied.
“It’s a ballad concert.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“'On the banks of the Wabash far
away,’” I answered. “A simple sentiment
would suit me exactly this evening. Yes,
I think I’ll come, thank you, Caroline.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I should like you to, Rol, dear, you
know; but your cold——”</p>

<p class='c012'>Of course, my cold; I didn’t know I had
one, but they had made a chronic asthmatic
of me lately.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And besides, Rol, Mr. Chatterton said
he might call this evening. I’m awfully
sorry, dear; but can you come to-morrow
to the Globe matinée?”</p>

<p class='c012'>They knew my prospective engagements
better than I knew them myself. There
was a trifling foolish committee meeting
toward to-morrow, and with that I had
to be content.</p>

<p class='c012'>But a tiff is the Compleat Bachelor’s opportunity,
and in the invitation to <i>Tristan</i>
I spied entertainment.</p>

<p class='c012'>Carrie had sunk gently on my knee, and
had placed a small finger through a buttonhole
of my coat. Bassishaw had just called,
dressed with the immaculate precision of
one who has made up his mind to sulk in
his stall, and had taken up a book on jurisprudence
which I kept conscientiously on
my table, an imposing reminiscence of my
younger days. He watched Carrie furtively
over the top of it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Please, Rol,” she said, the finger working
detrimentally through the buttonhole.
“You know you love <i>Tristan</i>, and Jean
and Edouard——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But three cannot listen to <i>Tristan</i>,” I
replied. “Whose hand am I to——”</p>

<p class='c012'>She came closer, and a mute look in her
eyes said that an Irrevocable Destiny had
made of her life a Blighted Tract.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But my cold, Caroline?” I asked
consumptively.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Rollo, you shall have hot rum
directly you come in, and I’ll nurse you.
<i>Do</i> come.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I acceded with secret joy, on the condition
of being spared the remedy she suggested.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then we will dine out,” I added.</p>

<p class='c012'>We did so, in a gloomy depression of
spirits that was eminently desirable. Carrie’s
humor was not improved by the sight
of a man at the next table, apparently
chastely-minded, but who took chutney to
a grilled steak. She has an instinct for
dietetic refinements, and looks on culinary
barbarity as worse than untruthfulness.</p>

<p class='c012'>I had to do most of the talking, which I
did, I think, in a naïve unconsciousness of
the summer cloudlet that loomed glowering
over the party. I spoke of youth. I said,
Heaven forgive me, that it was the happiest
period of life; that when the heart
smiled in love the skies had a blueness;
and much more of the same kind. Bassishaw
grunted remarks on the Transvaal
prospect, and for Carrie’s benefit muttered
something about shipment of troops and
leave-taking at Waterloo.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m going to see about my kit to-morrow,”
he added, and drank three liqueurs
recklessly. Three liqueurs is a great
compliment to the girl you love; four the
very abandonment of careless devilry.</p>

<p class='c012'>Carrie tried feebly to show unconcern
as to their effect on his constitution, and I
took coffee in huge enjoyment.</p>

<p class='c012'>Bassishaw tipped the waiter with imprudent
extravagance, hailed a passing
hansom cabby—“Passing, not passing
handsome,” I ventured to observe, but got
no response—and magnanimously bowed
Carrie and myself into the cab, saying he
would follow. I told Carrie on the way
that I could not have wished a more desirable
brother-in-law.</p>

<p class='c012'>At the opera I modestly took the end
stall of the three, but Carrie moved me
along. She then settled herself listlessly
on my right, while Bassishaw, who had
arrived, glowered at the side-drums on my
left.</p>

<p class='c012'>He was utterly indifferent to the entrance
of the conductor, and the overture
to <i>Tristan</i> evidently brought no peace to
his soul. He fumed unholily, and threw
himself about in his seat in a way that
drew a remonstrating remark from an ardent
Vaaagnerite on his left. At the end
of the first act he went out for a cigarette,
apologising with formality as Carrie gathered
up her gown to allow him to pass.
Carrie’s pretty neck bowed a graceful
aloofness. When his straight back disappeared
behind the curtain, my sister
throwing a slanting glance to see if he
turned round, I sought her eyes, and
leaned over, speaking softly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Was it about your writing, my literary
little sister?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>She assented with a little gulp.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tell me, my dear,” I said, turning my
back on the Vaaagnerite next Arthur’s
empty seat, who was talking the cult
rather stridently.</p>

<p class='c012'>She told me in pure innocence of the
Conflict between Literature and Love.
She spoke of the Devotion to Work and
the Sacredness of a Mission. The dear
little soul was going to enlighten the
peoples!</p>

<p class='c012'>“And I asked Arthur’s opinion,” she
said, her breast rising.</p>

<p class='c012'>Never till then had I realised the forgetfulness
of love.</p>

<p class='c012'>Arthur’s opinion on literature!</p>

<p class='c012'>“And what did Arthur say, Caroline?”
I asked, composing myself as best I could.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He said he didn’t want women to be
clever, and they had no business to be.
He thought they only ought to be pretty,
and I was only inking my fingers. Then
I told him what George Eliot said, and he
said I’d been reading <i>Half Hours with
the Best Authors</i>.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And then you quarrelled?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ssh—yes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Arthur entered at this moment, and
stumbled back to his seat. The Vaaagnerite
broke off Götterdammerung at the
third syllable, and I fancy Arthur had
trodden on his toes. I had great sympathy
with Arthur. I particularly liked his
views on the art question; but he would
have to unbend to this poor little child on
my right.</p>

<p class='c012'>She had turned her head on her shoulder
during the love duet, and I could not see
her face. I held out my hand for her
opera-glasses, and raised them to my eyes.
The lenses were wet with tears—I suspected
it. I quietly passed them on to
Bassishaw, with the message still moist
upon them. It is only once in a lifetime
you see <i>Tristan</i> through such a medium.</p>

<p class='c012'>The next interval Bassishaw did not
smoke, but remained in his stall. He had
heard the love duet, too. I turned to him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That was wonderful music, Bassishaw,”
I said.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” he replied. “Do you know, Butterfield,
I think it’s awful fine, by Jove. I
can understand Johnnies doing that kind
of thing, you know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Quite so,” I answered. “To the Artist-Soul”—(I
capitalised the words pompously
with my voice)—“to the Artist-Soul, creation
is not a choice, but a need. The French
realise that in their word <i>besogne</i>——”</p>

<p class='c012'>He was not listening, and broke in:</p>

<p class='c012'>“You know, Butterfield, a Johnny must
have a darned useful brain-box on him to
do that—that sort of thing. It made me
feel no end queer. There’s an awful lot in
it, don’t you think?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Poor Bassishaw thought he understood
the music, but it was the opera-glasses that
had fetched him. He went on:</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s darned funny that a chap should
do that instead of drill and depôt work,
you know, Butterfield. You know, I always
thought too confounded much of curves
and trajectory, and all that stuff. I always
thought a chap was a bit of a muff who
fooled with music and verses and all that,
do you know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The confession was not without a touch
of the pathetic, but I maintained a diplomatic
silence.</p>

<p class='c012'>After a thoughtful pause he continued:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you think, Rollo—do you think—would—would
Carrie ever do anything of
that sort?—I—I—mean, something that
makes a chap feel—oh, hang it, you know
what I mean.”</p>

<p class='c012'>What could I say? My little sister was
looking very miserable—abstract truth is all
very well—I temporised.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, Bassishaw, it can’t be done without
trying. You’ve got to stick at it. The
continual <i>enfantement</i>——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know,” he interrupted, “sort of keep
it up steady, like these gunnery Johnnies.
It must be darned hard. Do you know,
Butterfield,” he said, dropping his voice
suddenly, “Carrie and I—we’ve had a kind
of—nothing, you know—but—a bit of a
split.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You surprise me,” I replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, we have, really; and I think I was
a bit of a brute.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He rambled in explanations, which I
punctuated with “Dear, dear.” Carrie laid
her hand on my sleeve, and I turned to
her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Rol,” she whispered, “do send Arthur
for some coffee. I want to talk to you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Arthur was despatched to find a waiter,
and I attended Carrie’s pleasure while she
twisted her fingers nervously through the
opera-glasses.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Rol,” she said, “I’m so unhappy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Wings of Sorrow have brushed
your life and left it an Arid Waste,” I replied
sententiously, hugely amused. She
didn’t divine the raillery.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But surely, Rol, the heart is ripened
through suffering,” she replied unconsciously.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” I replied. “The Separation
of Souls is not Eternal. Those we love
are severed from us in the flesh, but in
Heaven——”</p>

<p class='c012'>She looked suspiciously, but my face was
very grave. The waiter appeared with coffee,
and Arthur resumed his seat, this time
without apology. He was anxious to make
it up, but I didn’t offer him my seat. I
wanted to see the particular kind of <i>finesse</i>
he would adopt, so lay low and
watched him.</p>

<p class='c012'>The music recommenced, and Caroline,
by some inattentiveness, retained her coffee
cup, which I believe she mentally identified
with Isolde’s love potion. Bassishaw was
revolving ways and means, but the cup
hint was not obvious to him. Isolde began
the Liebestod song, while the head of the
Vaaagnerite beyond Arthur was sunk in
his hands, possibly not to see the corpulent
heroine, whose presence was somewhat disturbing
to the music. The Wagner hush
was over all.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was broken by Bassishaw. Unable to
solve the difficulty, he cut the knot. His
hand came over my knee, and took the hand
of Caroline that was hanging in limp appeal
nearest him. She turned her face away,
but allowed the hand to remain. It was
all over, and I leaned back to commune
with my thoughts, and to adjust my mind
to the prospect of being once more a superfluity.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I say, Butterfield, old chap,” Bassishaw
whispered to me, “do you mind changing
places? This is rather awkward, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is conspicuous,” I replied, “but commendably
frank. I rather admire your way
of doing these things, Bassishaw. But we
can’t change now. You’ll have to wait
your opportunity of giving me the slip in
the foyer—I’ve no doubt you’ll attempt
it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It would do them no harm to wait a
while.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch08' class='c013'>VIII <br /> <br />A VETERAN RECRUIT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Millicent Dixon’s uncle, Col. Elliott
Coke, invalided from some remote Afghan
frontier station whose name on the map
was utterly out of proportion to the inconsiderableness
of the place, was in London.
I met him at the Bassishaws’ when Arthur,
in tones of infinite respect, had pointed out
to my notice a small, keen face, curried by
Indian suns, with moustaches out of which
both the colour and the moisture had been
grilled years and years before.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I say, Rollo,” Bassishaw had whispered,
“do you know who that is? That’s Col.
Coke.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s a good name,” I observed. “Who’s
he?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who’s he? I say, Rollo! Why, he’s
the best authority on hill batteries and
jungle skirmishes in India! Led an attack
on some darned place or other in—I forget
the date. V. C. Went through the
Afghan war, you know—got about a hundred
and fifty clasps.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Indeed?” I said. “Present me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Arthur had presented me to his hero
almost apologetically, and I had since improved
the acquaintance considerably.</p>

<p class='c012'>I gathered from the Colonel that the
Afghan frontier was not overrun with European
ladies to any great extent, and certainly
the little man’s manner on being transported
to a place where a full numerical half of
the population (and a much larger proportion
in every other respect) consisted of
women, was very pleasant to watch. The
luxury of seeing them was almost enough
for him, and when it came to the intimacies
of conversation the little warrior’s embarrassment
was as delightful as young
Ted Carmichael’s.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Gad, Butterfield,” he said, as we
threaded Piccadilly one evening, “this is
home, you know! It’s like one big family—you
feel as if you can speak to any of
them!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Colonel’s observation was perhaps
truer than he had any idea of; but I
couldn’t dash his boyish pleasure.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” I replied. “I almost envy you
the delight, Coke, of having the full measure
all at once. It is to you what tiger-shooting
would be to me, did my tastes run
in that direction.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Gad,” he replied (he seldom replied without
“Gad”), “it’s marvellous! And all
with faces as white as my own, Butterfield!”</p>

<p class='c012'>I smiled, looking at the piece of tropical
cookery he called white, but let him run on.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you know,” he said, “there was Powell’s
wife, and poor Jack Dennis’s widow,
and the adjutant’s sister; and, by Gad, except
for a <i>dahi</i> that Powell kept (Powell’s
wife was never strong), there wasn’t another
woman, Butterfield, in the whole damned
station! And Winifred Dennis didn’t
amount to much. But here——”</p>

<p class='c012'>He never seemed to get accustomed to
it. Had a London fog stamped the metropolitan
complexion indelibly and universally
black, Coke would have given a sigh,
as knowing that his glimpse was too good
to have lasted, and returned to his old order
of things. The rustle of a silk skirt was
an unstaled wonder to him; and the contrast
between what he called the “real
European baby-ribbon sort of thing” and
the “infernal blouse and puggaree business”
never failed to entertain him.</p>

<p class='c012'>With Miss Dixon he was soon on good
terms, but with most other ladies, Mrs.
Loring Chatterton first of all, his diffidence
was marked. His chivalrous devotion was
Quixotic, but most of them would have
bartered it, I am sure, for a more work-a-day
and less punctilious style of attention.
Mrs. Loring, indeed, said so.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know where he got his style of
conversation from,” she remarked, “but he
is absolutely embarrassed when I present
him to a woman. How do you account for
it, Mr. Butterfield?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is not,” I replied, “that he is deficient
in physical bravery. I can only account for
it on the supposition of instinct. He knows
your propensities, Mrs. Loring, and would
possibly die as he has lived, a blameless
bachelor.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But it’s just the same with the married
women,” she returned. “What is there to
be afraid of in Alice Carmichael?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I decline to be invidious, Mrs. Loring,”
I replied. “He gets along well enough with
Millicent Dixon.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They are related,” she replied, somewhat
inconclusively.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am afraid it is a <i>non sequitur</i>,” I answered.
“Friendship generally varies inversely
as the square of the distance of the
relationship.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wonder what we could do?” she said,
half to herself. “Do you think Mrs. Gervase
would do him any good?”</p>

<p class='c012'>The wicked, wedded creature! Emily
Gervase, a youthful widow, was Cicely
Vicars’s sister. I drew myself up with dignity.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mrs. Loring,” I said, looking full at
her, “I wonder that you do not tremble!
What is it you would do? Has Col. Coke,
of a score of Indian hill fights, the bearer of
honourable scars of war and climate, not
earned his peace? Would you, now that
his body is broken on the outposts of an
Empire for your protection, harrow the boyish
soul within it? No, madam. On me,
if you will, you may exercise your arts;
but if you once submit that venerable head
to the machinations of Emily Gervase—I
expose you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Exercise arts on you!” she retorted.
“You’re too fond of it; and I <i>shall</i> be—nice—to
the Colonel, in spite of you, Mr.
Butterfield.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She kept her word. She indulged her
undoubted gifts for being “nice” to people
in a series of variations, the theme of which
was always the same—the development of
the Colonel’s intimacy with Mrs. Gervase.
Mrs. Loring’s methods were old enough to
me—I knew them by heart; but to the
maiden soul of the Colonel they came as a
revelation of female unselfishness.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you know, Butterfield,” he said to
me one evening, “I’m beginning to think
Mrs. Chatterton is no end of a fine woman,
by Gad! She’s loyal, by Gad! The way
she stands by that little friend of hers,
Mrs. Gervase—you know her”—(I nodded)—“why,
it’s just what a man would do!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then you have met Mrs. Gervase,
Coke?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” he replied, “the other evening.
She’s infernally shy, by Gad! Quiet, you
know. That’s what I like about an Englishwoman
here. Now, Powell’s wife, and the
regimental women——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Exactly; were not shy. And what do
you think of Mrs. Gervase?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, you know,”—the little man
looked at me with a comical air of worldly
knowledge that was a joy to see,—“she
was awfully quiet, Butterfield—only looked
at you; but <i>I</i> brought her out, by Gad!
And she’s intelligent, too, when you once
get her talking.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You succeeded in making her talk,
then?” I asked with an irony that was for
my private satisfaction, and meant nothing
to him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” he replied, “after I’d—played
her a bit, you know. And that woman,
Butterfield, displayed an intelligence, by
Gad, on transport, and commissariat, and
mobilisation that was simply little short of
marvellous! Marvellous, by Gad!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“She’s a clever woman, I believe,” I answered.
“She asked you how often you
had been wounded, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“She <i>did</i> ask me that,” he admitted;
“but women haven’t got to hear about
that kind of thing, you know, Butterfield.
You’ve got to keep ’em at arm’s length in
such matters—kind of——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Exactly. Play them a bit. I congratulate
you, Colonel, on having—er—brought
out Mrs. Gervase.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh,” he replied, “she’s only a child, of
course, widow or no widow; but she’ll
make a fine woman, Butterfield.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I would have given much that Emily
Gervase should have heard herself set
down a child. The Colonel, unconsciously,
had in his hand the opportunity
for complete and sweeping revenge.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was my fortune to be present when
Mrs. Gervase, doubtless after deep consideration,
made the next move. We were
to call on Mrs. Charlie Vicars—or rather,
Coke was to call, and persuaded me along
with him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mrs. Chatterton said you wouldn’t
mind, Butterfield,” he said; “and, by Gad,
I can’t keep two of them going.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You undervalue yourself, Coke,” I said.
“But I’ll come.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And so we found ourselves in the
æstheticism of Mrs. Vicars’s drawing-room.
That lady found means to entertain me,
while Coke applied himself to the creation
of a conversational warmth that should
induce the unfolding of the timid bud by
his side.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Col. Coke seems to have taken quite
a fancy to Emily, Mr. Butterfield?” said
Mrs. Charlie interrogatively.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is a pretty sight, Mrs. Vicars,” I
replied. “The scarred veteran in the
evening of his life, his grim battles behind
him, returning to take a younger generation
on his knee——”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Vicars looked round in alarm.</p>

<p class='c012'>“—And to tell of fights in which their
fathers were engaged——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Col. Coke is not so old as that, Mr.
Butterfield. He can’t be much older than
you,” she interrupted.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He is young enough to be Emily’s
father,” I admitted, “and perhaps a little
too juvenile to be her grandfather. Coke
is fifty.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He doesn’t look it, Mr. Butterfield.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He looks it, Mrs. Vicars, and you know
it. Let us talk about something else. How
is Master—Percival, is his name to be?”</p>

<p class='c012'>The young gentleman in question had
known the light of day for exactly three
weeks, and was the commencement of Cicely
Vicars’s family. I had been presented to
him in his cot some days before, but beyond
mutual celibacy, there was little as yet in
common between us, and the conversation
had flagged.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” Mrs. Vicars responded, “he’s to
be called Percival; and oh, Mr. Butterfield,
he’s to be christened in a week, and I
wondered——”</p>

<p class='c012'>She hesitated.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I already stand sponsor to an embarrassing
extent, Mrs. Vicars,” I replied.
“I never ascertained precisely to what
the position pledged me, but I have an uncomfortable
sense of responsibility to which
I do not feel inclined to add.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But, Mr. Butterfield, those were—other
people’s children—not mine.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She turned a supplicating eye on me. It
runs in the family.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Naturally,” I replied. “It would be a
big burden, in these days of small families,
for any one person. But no, Mrs. Vicars.
Perhaps on a future occasion——I have
it!” I added.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You have what?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Coke’s your man, Mrs. Vicars. Come.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I rose, and assisted her to rise also. She
hung back, but I brought her along. It
was the very thing! We approached the
couple. The Colonel was holding forth
on the dialects of the North-Western Provinces.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Coke!” I said. He looked up.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Accept my felicitations. You are to
stand godfather to Mrs. Vicars’s little boy
next week.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Coke blushed a vivid gamboge, and
stopped dead.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Gad!” he stammered. “Wha—what’s
that, Butterfield?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sponsor, my dear Coke,” I returned,
“at the investiture of a fellow-man with a
name. You’re just the man.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Things were whirling round Coke. He
grasped the edge of the sofa with both
hands, and looked blankly at us.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Me!” he gasped, “me! at a christening!
What the devil—me a godfather! No, I’m
damned if I can!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“My dear Coke,” I answered, “calm yourself.
Of course you can—you must! A
man with the Victoria Cross cannot get
out of these things so easily. Look at me—a
baker’s dozen at least.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Gad,” he replied, wiping his brow, “I’d
rather get the Cross again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nonsense,” I replied. “It’s a duty.
Somebody did it for us, and we keep up
the tradition. Besides, it’s unlucky to have
to ask twice.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I had no authority for this last statement,
but it seemed to go. Coke leaned back
for ease in breathing.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But I’ve never done anything of the
kind,” he almost whispered. “I shall shake
like a recruit. I shan’t know what to do—I
shall get mixed up with the bridesmaids——”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Colonel’s notions as to the procedure
of christenings were undoubtedly vague.
I looked at Mrs. Gervase.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This is not a wedding,” I said, “but a
christening. That’s all right, Coke. You
shall wear your uniform and grasp the hilt
of your sword all the time. You’ll do.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But—but—hang it, Butterfield, what
about the family? You’ll pardon me,
ladies, but I—you are the only members I
am happy enough to know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh,” said Mrs. Vicars, “there’s only
mother, Colonel. I forgot you hadn’t met her.
You shall to-morrow. You do promise?”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Colonel was evidently looking for
flaws in the position, but seemed to find
none. He rose, as unhappy a little soldier
as ever wore a medal.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, ladies,” he said, “I would rather
have shot Afghans for you for twelve
months than undertake this—this post. If
I break down you mustn’t blame me. I’ll
do my best.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And with a sigh he pulled his white
moustaches nervously, and we begged
leave to go.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now, my only object in all this was a
half-whimsical protest, such as is permissible
against what was evidently in the minds of
both these ladies—the matching of Mrs.
Gervase with a man easily twenty years
her senior. The position of godfather to
a succeeding generation, apart from the
edification of seeing such a man as Coke in
such a capacity, was much more suitable
than any wedding so uneven, and I had
allowed myself to hint as much. But
Coke himself, as he afterwards told me, had
carried the thing a good deal further.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was in the smoke-room of the Fainéant
Club that I heard its conclusion. The
ceremony was over, and Coke was composing
his nerves with green Indian cigars.
He had sat meditatively watching the
smoke for some time, when he suddenly
looked up and caught my eye.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, Butterfield,” he said, “I got it
over; but, by Gad, never again! They
shall call 'Deserters’ next time for
me!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes?” I said inquiringly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” he replied. “It was this way,
Butterfield. I called on Mrs. Vicars next
day, and met her mother, and, by Gad,
Butterfield”—the Colonel threw his cigar
away in his excitement, and faced full
round on me—“it was little Cissie Munro,
who threw me over before I left, thirty
years ago! By Gad”—he sank back in
his chair—“you could have pulled my
shoulder-straps off! I knew her in a
minute. I didn’t know whether she was
living or dead, Butterfield. I’m used to
my friends dying—and there, by Gad, she
turns up! My stars, it beats all!”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was certainly a coincidence.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And the awkward part of the whole
thing was—I don’t mind telling <i>you</i>, Butterfield—that
I’d all but taken a fancy to
that quiet little daughter of hers, Mrs.
Gervase. Well, I was all at sea; the whole
thing was too infernally odd. It didn’t
seem right, somehow, that I should be
thrown over by one woman, make love to
her daughter, and be godfather to what
might have been my own grandchild, by
Gad; and I was in no end of a mess. Don’t
you think so?”</p>

<p class='c012'>I admitted the questionableness of the
proceeding.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, I could not get out of the confounded
christening—thanks to you, Butterfield,—but
as to Mrs. Gervase, that was
another matter. I can help that. And
she’s a good little woman, too,” he added,
“if she were not so infernally modest, by
Gad.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think it is, perhaps, better, Coke,” I
replied.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch09' class='c013'>IX <br /> <br />THE ETHICS OF ANGLING</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>I don’t quite know how Mrs. Loring
came to pick the Gibsons up. They were
not what Carrie termed “quite nice
people”; in what respect it was easy to see
and difficult to say. Their jewellery was
unexceptionable, and barely ostentatious;
their manners passed the presentation
standard, if falling a little short in the
nicer requirements of the <i>tête-à-tête</i>. They
did not offend in the matter of “Mr.”
and “Esq.,” but sniffed somewhat of
“R. S. V. P.” Mrs. Gibson, too, insisted
on the forms of chaperonage in a way
that was rather more than a passing bow
to custom, and which suggested the possibility
of her having learned the necessity
in a different school from that of Mrs.
Loring Chatterton. They had money.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What do you think of the Gibsons,
Rol?” Carrie had said to me; “<i>I</i> don’t
like them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I would rather introduce them to my
relatives than to my friends,” I replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was pretty evident to me after a short
acquaintance with the Gibsons that they
were disposed to make much of me.
Carrie noticed the same thing, and spoke
her mind on the subject with the freedom
of engaged youth.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mrs. Gibson’s a horrid woman, Rol,
and it’s my opinion she wants you to
marry Miss Gibson.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Caroline,” I replied, “I applaud your
concern, yet cannot blame Mrs. Gibson.
She can see virtue where others see but
corpulence. Besides, I consider Miss
Gibson rather pretty.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m sure she’s not pretty,” retorted
Caroline, and proceeded to enlighten me
on matters interesting and feminine.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mamma played the only game she knew
very skilfully. Her only mistake was in
the inapplicability of the means, which
was not her fault. Indeed, I feel almost
apologetically responsible myself, seeing
the line worked so thoroughly, and mused
instructively on the devotion of a mother
to her child’s prospects.</p>

<p class='c012'>Miss Gibson was accomplished, and expensively
finished. As I had remarked
to Carrie, she was decidedly pretty, and
would talk Ibsen to you with her face in
profile. She displayed an obtrusive girlhood
that was not always as modest as its
intention, and this pose of maidenhood in
bud was apparently the one designed to
net me.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Gibson gave a <i>musicale</i>, to which
I persuaded Carrie with difficulty. She
had evidently talked things over with Mrs.
Loring, for that lady appeared also, and I
was greatly gratified at the concern with
which they watched me. I decided to
give them all the entertainment they
desired. They talked with an obvious
intention of interesting me and keeping
me apart from Miss Gibson. I was surprised
to see so little strategy in a married
woman.</p>

<p class='c012'>Miss Gibson was running a risk of
palsying her hand in a vibrant mandolin
solo, and producing music suggestive of
the dotted line of a wheel-pen. I heard
Carrie whisper to Mrs. Loring something
about “St. Vitus’s Waltz,” for which I
reproved her, considering whose house
she was in. I then addressed Mrs.
Loring.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Somehow, Mrs. Loring,” I said, “one
thinks more of English maidenhood as one
advances in life. There is something in
the unsophisticated rosebud——”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Loring nodded significantly, implying
there was a good deal in the unsophisticated
rosebud, but I waited my
time; I had a bolt in store for her.</p>

<p class='c012'>Miss Gibson had finished the solo in a
tinsel diminuendo, the intent of which was
to enchain the soul a while longer in the
regions to which it had been raised. I
rose and crossed over to her. She was untangling
herself from a mesh of coloured
mandolin ribbons that <i>would</i> catch in the
ruching of her corsage.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They’re <i>such</i> a nuisance, Mr. Butterfield;
I shall cut them off, I think.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I smiled at the unintentional suggestion,
and assisted her in the extrication, glancing
across at Mrs. Loring’s disapproving face.
Miss Gibson sat down and made room for
me beside her. She twined the mandolin
ribbons among her fingers, and Mrs. Gibson
moved further away.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are you leaving town soon, Mr. Butterfield?”
inquired the unsophisticated
rosebud engagingly.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a better opening than I had
looked for; I took advantage of it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I had meditated going down into the
country for a little fishing shortly,” I replied;
“probably in a week or two.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are fond of fishing, are you not,
Mr. Butterfield?” she inquired, tying
a knot in a red ribbon.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s a pleasure,” I answered, “as much
of the mind as of the body. I know of
nothing more exciting than the suspense of
the first nibble. The angler, male or female,
has peculiar joys and fears of which
the layman knows nothing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, I should <i>so</i> love it!” replied Miss
Gibson, glancing down at a small shoe that
protruded from the lacy hem of her skirts.
I followed her glance, and knew in my
soul that Mrs. Loring and Carrie were
watching me.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The first nibble taken,” I continued,
warming to my work, “all the <i>finesse</i> of
playing your victim commences. There is
a wide difference between hooking your fish
and landing him. He must be humoured
and coaxed, or you lose him, bait and all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I took one of the ribbons in my hand.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It must be most annoying to have all
your trouble for nothing, is it not, Mr. Butterfield?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You follow me perfectly,” I replied,
“especially when you have made sure of
your fish. Often enough you have chosen
the wrong fly, or your line has been seen
by the fish; and he is a shy thing, a very
timid creature.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She laid groundbait for me by dropping
her fan. I nibbled again, and returned it
to her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The fish, too, becomes cunning with
age; and you must not play a middle-aged
trout as a boy does a minnow. Believe
me, Miss Gibson, he is not easily caught, if
he is worth the landing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Gibson passed with a smile, but did
not disturb the situation. I rose to get Miss
Gibson an ice, and resumed my seat near
her. She placed the mandolin on the other
side, adjusted her gown, and diminished the
distance between us by an inch. Again
her fan dropped, and as we both stooped to
pick it up our hands touched.</p>

<p class='c012'>Honestly, I acquit Miss Gibson of intention.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yet another method of landing your
trout,” I continued, “is by what is called
'tickling’; but then your fish must be
asleep, and it cannot fairly be classed as
sport.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But surely, Mr. Butterfield,” said Miss
Gibson, playing me with her eyes, “fishing
must be very cruel? Fancy the poor thing
with the hook!—doesn’t it hurt?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I believe,” I returned, “they rather enjoy
it, Miss Gibson; particularly what is
called the softer-mouthed kind of fish.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How very curious!” said the credulous
rosebud, somewhat absently. She evidently
took my remarks on the subject as
so much natural history, and was interested
in them only as such. She glanced at the
mandolin ribbons, and I saw her revolving
means of supplementing the line by the net.
She made a fresh cast.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And how long do you expect to be
away, Mr. Butterfield?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Loring and Carrie were approaching;
but Mrs. Gibson, who had not apparently
been watching, intercepted them,
and dammed the stream adroitly. Carrie
was placed at the piano, and the preserve
maintained inviolate. Mrs. Loring talked
sweetly to her hostess, with one eye on me.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I could not say,” I replied. “Until my
friends yearn for me back again, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She made the response elementary, and
shortened her line.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But your friends will be sorry to lose
you at all,” she replied, with a soft sparkle
under her lashes. “I’m sure mother
will.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Indeed?” I answered. “My friends
conceal their desire for my presence with
most generous consideration. I am allowed
great liberty.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Mr. Butterfield, how can you say
so?”</p>

<p class='c012'>I ought not to have done it. I reproach
myself for it. But the temptation! Miss
Gibson was really nice, if not “quite nice.”
It was unfair; but I am of no stronger fibre
than my fellow-men. As I leaned forward,
I knew that the landing-net was ready, and
the gaff poised. I sought her eyes, and
spoke low.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Shall <i>you</i> be sorry to lose me, Miss
Gibson?”</p>

<p class='c012'>The colour rose faintly on her cheek.
She hesitated, her eyes cast down. She
had not fallen in love with me. It was
the mother’s doing.</p>

<p class='c012'>Help came from outside. Mrs. Gibson
blinked her vigilance for one short moment.
Carrie crowded the last few bars of music
into an accelerando that would have harrowed
the soul of the composer, and she
and Mrs. Loring were upon us.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Miss Gibson,” said Carrie, with a
sweetness of expression that astonished
me, considering the real state of her feelings,
“do please play again. Rollo and I
must go very shortly, and we should so
love to hear you. Won’t you, dear?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We cannot possibly leave without,”
implored Mrs. Chatterton.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nothing was possible but compliance,
and Miss Gibson took her seat near the
piano.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Loring and Caroline mounted determined
guard over me, one on each side,
but didn’t speak. It was not until we
were on the way home that the storm broke.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Rollo Butterfield,” said Mrs. Loring
icily, “I’m deeply surprised at you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And why, my dear Mrs. Loring?” I
asked blandly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Did you propose to that—that Gibson
girl?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Proposal, Mrs. Loring,” I replied, “is
an excitement that would be of more general
indulgence but for the risk of acceptance.
It is a valuable sensation, and I
greatly regret its attendant danger.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You have no more perception than a
child. Don’t you know that those people
are doing all they can to catch you? I
never saw anything so shameless.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She had asked for it, and she should
have it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mrs. Loring,” I replied slowly and
distinctly, “your ingenuousness charms
me. You call Mrs. Gibson’s conduct
shameless: yet you yourself would empty
half the bachelors’ clubs in London. I
forget precisely the number of years it is
since you first endeavored to curtail my
own celibate freedom, but I believe you
have devoted no small part of your attention
to my poor case.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Millie Dixon is different,” she retorted.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of course Millicent was different, but I
held her to the logic.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We are not discussing Millicent, but
the ethics of angling. I am surprised that
you should not recognise your own position
in the matter. You do not want me to be
more precise?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t want you to be anything but
moderately sane,” she returned. “If you
can’t see the difference between the Gibsons
and Millicent Dixon——”</p>

<p class='c012'>She left me to conclude the sentence for
myself. Mrs. Loring Chatterton was in a
bad temper, and evaded the argument pettishly.
I turned to Caroline.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Has my little sister anything to say?”
I asked, in a “come one come all” tone.</p>

<p class='c012'>She hadn’t. She cuddled her face against
my shoulder, and pulled nervously at her
glove fingers.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But, Rol, dear,” she said anxiously,
“what <i>were</i> you and Miss Gibson talking
about?”</p>

<p class='c012'>I took her hand.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nothing, Caroline,” I replied, “but a
few observations on the trout, his habits, and
the method of his capture.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Exemplifying the fact,” Mrs. Loring
struck in crossly, “that he is a cold-blooded
creature.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Loring scored a bye.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch10' class='c013'>X <br /> <br />AN UNDRESS REHEARSAL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Millicent Dixon had called on me unexpectedly,
soaked from neck to ankle. I
had been watching the vertical downpour
from my window—long, heavy slate-pencils
of water, that rebounded from the pavement
in a mist a foot high,—and listening
to the hurrying runnels that sluiced the
gutters. It was full, uncompromising rain,
and it thrashed steadily from the invisible
cullender that had been a sky an hour ago.
Millicent stood before me with her hand on
the door, half vexed, but laughing out of
her sodden garments.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now don’t sit there looking at me, Mr.
Butterfield,” she exclaimed, as I admired at
her plight with eyes half closed; “get me
some things.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I considered weightily.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have in the house at present,” I
replied, “several morning suits, a Norfolk
jacket, evening wear, pink silk——”</p>

<p class='c012'>She tapped impatiently with her foot,
shaking a sliver of little drops from the
hem of her gown.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Or perhaps fishing attire would
be——?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t be ponderous. Where’s Caroline?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Caroline, Miss Dixon, is out with
Arthur, and will doubtless return in much
the same state of rainwater as yourself.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She disappeared towards Carrie’s quarters,
her dress making a wet slap on the
door as she whisked round. I rose to prepare
brandy during her absence.</p>

<p class='c012'>It should be mentioned that I was confined
to my room with a slight attack of
rheumatism, which my considerate friends
persisted in regarding as gout. As a matter
of fact the affection was purely muscular,
and I indignantly repudiated the fuller
flavour of the alleged complaint. My portliness
must not be confounded with decadence.</p>

<p class='c012'>Disconsolately enough, I had been
fingering and sorting old letters, turning
out drawer after drawer of forgotten trifles,
and feeling none the younger in consequence.
It was borne in upon me that I had a
history, or some record of trivialities that
passed as such; and these little drifted
relics of the past had curiously discounted
the glamour of what was going to happen
to-morrow. Except for the unexpected
shower, I should probably have been left to
this melancholy occupation all day; and
Millicent’s forced visit was very welcome.</p>

<p class='c012'>She reappeared in garments of Caroline’s,
passable in style, but with marked
qualifications in the fit. She tops Caroline
by three inches. I had often wondered
idly where that three inches was accounted
for, and how it was distributed. I knew
now.</p>

<p class='c012'>I surveyed her critically.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Shoulders not bad,” I remarked, walking
round her, while she stood at a laughing
attention for kit inspection. “Waist—turn
round—hm!—an inch and a half at
most; all right so long as you don’t lean
forward. Skirt—ah, the skirt—well, well,
I’m past such things. Really, it’s not bad
for an improvisation.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I couldn’t find Carrie’s slippers,” she
said, putting forward a small foot.</p>

<p class='c012'>The skirt had already revealed the silk-clad
toes. I got her a particularly large
pair of my own, brought her the brandy,
which she drank like a sensible woman of
twenty-eight, placed her an armchair near
the fire, and resumed my own seat. Then
I sought her eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It was most thoughtful of you, Miss
Dixon, to remember an invalid, and to pay
such a welcome call. I appreciate it. In
the rain, too.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Irony was wasted on this shameless woman.
She looked at me boldly, and laughed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I assure you, Mr. Butterfield,” she
replied, “the last thing I thought of when
I left home was coming to see you. But
oh, the rain! Look at it now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I was conscious of the fresh smell of wet
pavement from where I sat—the window
was open. The wheels of a hansom went
past with a watery swish, the horse’s hoofs
slapping clear in the deserted street, and
the stones shone with a cleanness that they
had not known for a month.</p>

<p class='c012'>“At any rate,” I said magnanimously,
“you’re here for an hour or two. It’s not
going to stop yet. You may as well make
a virtue of entertaining me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She bowed mockingly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is I who am entertained,” she
replied. “You have helped me in a
watery dilemma. I am in your home. I
wear your——”</p>

<p class='c012'>I stopped her. They were not mine.
They were Caroline’s.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Slippers,” she continued, crossing them
on the fender. “I think I’ll take Caroline’s
place while she’s gadding about with
Arthur.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Again I stopped her. She was not in
Caroline’s shoes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Besides, Miss Dixon,” I added, “are
you not a little premature in offering to be
a sister to me?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Never mind,” she replied, laughing;
“call it housekeeper, if you like.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The imputation,” I answered, “is monstrous.
I am a respectable bachelor, and
never had such a thing. And if I had, she
would have appeared before me in a fitting
state—not a misfitting one.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then we’d better make it sister after
all,” she returned, “and my first duty is to
demand what you were doing when I came
in.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I glanced at the half-sorted piles of notes,
cards, ancient invitations, mementoes, and
the hundred other matters which had
doubtless been of more or less importance
in their day, and shrugged my shoulders.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know,” said Miss Dixon, “it is rather
dreadful. Seems like reading some one
else’s letters. Let me help you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She put out her hand for the nearest
packet. I placed my own firmly on
hers.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Miss Dixon,” I said slowly, “who are
you that you would plunge thus recklessly
into the tied-up part of a now reformed
bachelor? That particular bundle is least
of all fit for a sister’s perusal.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“If Caroline neglected her duty,” she
retorted, “that is no reason why I should
do the same. I want to see them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You had better take these instead,” I
returned, pushing towards her a tray of
wedding cards.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I insist.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You insist?” I replied, in the tone of
one speaking to a naughty child. “How
old are you, Miss Dixon?”</p>

<p class='c012'>She laughed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think I am a good deal older than
you, Rollo, in this respect; I don’t keep
letters as I did when I was a sentimental
schoolgirl. I destroy <i>that</i> kind.” And she
nodded towards the bundle.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Indeed?” I said. “And why did you
not tell me sooner? That would have been
valuable information to me at one time.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And why?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I might have written a good deal more
than I did.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You never wrote anything unfitted for
my sheltered youth,” she replied, quietly
smiling, and burrowing one foot deeper
into the cavernous recesses of a slipper.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t post all I write,” I corrected,
“but I have written things that would
have amazed a Bassishaw—and thought
twice about it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Bassishaw doesn’t say much in his letters,”
she said musingly. She and Caroline
were very good friends, and there had
doubtless been a good deal of inter-feminine
confidence between them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But why don’t you post them?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh,” I replied offhand, “they are experiments.
It is another way of keeping
a diary. Perhaps, after all, you may see
them if you care to. They are merely
studies in moods.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I untied the packet.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here you are,” I continued. “Arthur
Bassishaw, Esq., on the occasion of his
engagement to Caroline. Good advice—but
a little too late. It wouldn’t have been
taken, anyway, from what I know of
His Omnipotent Youthfulness. Never
posted.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It might have been worth while to
post it for the sake of reply,” Millicent returned
smiling; “you’d have had something
badly written, but very ardent.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I shook my head.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Bassishaw’s sword would be a good
deal mightier than his pen,” I replied. “To
see him in the throes of composition is a
felicity I have hitherto missed. Now here’s
another: to Caroline, on the same occasion.
That, Millicent, cost me some trouble to
write, and I am afraid it showed it—I have
only one sister, you know. Unposted.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That was rather nice of you, Rollo,”
she said.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I should only have given myself away,”
I returned. “Now this, to Mrs. Bassishaw,
is one of two—the other one was posted.
It was a hard alternative. I sent the usual
nice thing; Mrs. Bassishaw would understand
that. This”—I tapped the envelope—“would
have appeared difficult to a
widow still young, and still in the running
with her own son.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Millicent nodded. There were reasons
for Mrs. Bassishaw’s conduct which her
relatives approved and her friends condoned.</p>

<p class='c012'>“These,” I continued, turning over two
or three, “are small ebullitions that served
their end in leaving me in a better temper;
and in one at least of them I evaded a
state of mind in which I was feeling very
sorry for myself. It is a good game, don’t
you think?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Excellent,” she returned, “from the
point of view of your future biographer.
I suppose you have one eye on the memoir-writer,
Rollo. Is your statue to be equestrian?”</p>

<p class='c012'>I waived reply magnanimously, and
went on.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here is one to Mrs. Loring Chatterton;
and not unconnected with it, one to yourself.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“One to me?” she inquired, looking up.
“Why to me? What mood did that exemplify?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think, Millicent,” I replied, “that I
must have felt rather a regard for you that
evening.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She bowed ironically.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is nice to be thought well of,” she
replied, “even if the regard does stop at
the posting point. It was a wet night, I
suppose; or the servants had gone to bed?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The fires of the heart, Millicent,” I answered,
in pompous periods, at which she
only laughed, “are not quenched by rain.
Yon gutters that run so musically could no
more——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“'Oh, Captain Shaw!’” she sang softly,
“'type of true love kept under——’”</p>

<p class='c012'>I leaned back, tapping the letter with
the ends of my fingers, and signified my
willingness to wait until her operatic fervour
should have spent itself.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It must have been ferverish,” she said,
still laughing. “Did it take you long to
write?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“About eight years, Millicent,” I replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And not to be posted after all? Never
mind; I suppose I shall see it in the biography.
I declare I’m almost curious,
Rollo. Tell me, is it——?” She paused,
and looked fairly and quietly at me, with
an odd smile on her lips.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is,” I replied, returning her gaze.
“Would you care to read it, Millicent?”</p>

<p class='c012'>She rose and went to the window. A
cold grey light that heralded the passing of
the shower filled the room. The heavens
were relenting, and already a corner of the
leaden pall had lifted. Millicent would
probably take the opportunity to leave.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Would you care to read it?” I repeated,
looking over my shoulder.</p>

<p class='c012'>She faced round suddenly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, Rollo,” she said, “I should not.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are probably right,” I replied.
“Proposal is a venerable formality; but
the inevitable scene——”</p>

<p class='c012'>She walked back from the window and
stood before me, dignified in her heterogeneous
attire and perfectly serious.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I thought you knew better than that,
Rollo,” she said. “I don’t think there
would be any scene, and, anyway, I’m not
in my first season, you know.” She smiled
the same queer smile. “But if you think
that I should be interested in such a matter
merely as an—experiment in mood—you
wrong me, Rollo; and if, on the other hand,
I am to take it in the plainer sense, I should
like something less warmed up and out of
date. You can hardly call it fervid, can
you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>I admired Millicent in that moment. I
rose and took her hand.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Millicent,” I said, “I accept your rebuke.
There is nothing further to be said—just
now; but soon——”</p>

<p class='c012'>She laughed her accustomed laugh, the
same old Millicent again.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I shall be perfectly willing to consider
any representations you may have to make
on the subject, Rollo, provided they are
forwarded in the ordinary course. Will
you ring for tea?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch11' class='c013'>XI <br /> <br />QUEEN OF LOVE AND BEAUTY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>From what I was able to gather, the
course of young Ted Carmichael’s love
was highly meritorious in its constancy.
His affection was a solid, reliable fact, and,
to me, correspondingly uninteresting. His
father, I remembered, had, years before,
wooed little Alice Chatterton on much the
same lines, between which two it had
been what their friends called an “understood
thing,” since the first bashful glances
of adolescence. In both cases this trait
was regarded as a highly commendable
faithfulness, and invested with the usual
attributes of true and undying love; but
to me it had less of this positive quality
than appeared, and argued rather a certain
paucity of invention in the finer relations
of amorous adventure. It was admirable,
but the case was settled from the beginning,
and offered little field for speculation,
even its incidental tiffs and mischances
being in their rise and end perfectly
accountable. In the case of the son, his
three terms at Eton, coming when they
did, might have resulted in a break from
this monotonous routine of laudable love;
his father had been hopeless from the start.</p>

<p class='c012'>But Miss Nellie Bassishaw bade fair
for freer flights. During the occasional
intervals of my seeing her she seemed to
grow in sections and to develop in seasons,
and now, emancipated from the
last suggestion of governess, was gowned
and coifed beyond the limit of girlhood.
True, her neck still showed a whitish
celery colour from the unhabitual exposure,
and in the management of her feet
and skirt the last trace of the tomboy
was disappearing; but she displayed beneath
an eminently suitable hat glances
that promised in the near future a hundred
roguishnesses and mischiefs. If
anything could shake Ted’s devotion,
Miss Nellie, I decided, had it.</p>

<p class='c012'>Young Ted called on me one afternoon
for no reason at all that I could discover
during the first half-hour of his visit. He
was clad <i>point-devise</i>, bore his gloves and
cane with admirable instinct, and looked as
fresh and trim a youth as ever received the
half-motherly kiss of a widow. I greeted
him with pleasure.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And the match, Ted?” I asked, when
he had sat down; “how do you feel?”—Ted
was the youngest member of the
Eton eleven, which was to meet Harrow in
the annual match at Lord’s in a day or two.</p>

<p class='c012'>A troubled look crossed his face.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t feel a bit up to it, Butterfield,”
he replied. “I shall go and mess the confounded
thing, I know I shall. A fellow
who’s playing cricket shouldn’t have anything
on his mind—that is——”</p>

<p class='c012'>He paused, and flushed half angrily.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Anything wrong?” I asked in an offhand
tone.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” he replied—an affirmative “no,”—“nothing
that matters.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Only?” I prompted.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Only this,” he answered with another
flush, “that women oughtn’t to have anything
to do with cricket.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“From my experience,” I returned, “they
are invariably proud to see their sons playing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sons!” he replied. “Oh, it isn’t that—I
know my mother is all right. But it
doesn’t matter—much,” he concluded, in a
tone that was <i>not</i> intended as a hint to let
the matter drop.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, I see,” I replied sympathetically.
“Sorry, Ted. Of course, that does make
a difference. When you said 'women,’ I
thought for a moment you——Yes, it’s
very awkward. To know that in such a
crowd two eyes are aching with anxiety
that you should acquit yourself well must
be extremely trying to the nerves. I
should try to forget it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He fidgeted with his gloves, and then
turned sharp round.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And suppose they were not anxious?”
he retorted. “Suppose they didn’t care
whether you came off or not? Hang it,
Butterfield,” he continued, “you can imagine
what it’s like—they think because a
fellow hasn’t a moustache—it’s enough to
make a fellow go and drink rotten stuff. I
shan’t stand it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was Nellie. I got it all out of him.
He had evidently come to tell me. The
rude health of public school life had not
knocked the fancy out of him, and he had
come back to find her grown up and with a
tendency to be interested in men ten years
her senior. How he had managed to get
into the first eleven and to remain in love
was to me one of the mysteries of constancy.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But I thought you would have forgotten
almost, Ted,” I said, in the maturity of
our confidence. “It’s a year since you went
away.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A fellow never forgets,” he replied
sulkily. “It’s the girls who forget. Could
you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>I passed the point, and speculated on the
validity of pledges on eternity.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And she has—pardon me—snubbed
you?” I inquired, after a while.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, no,” he rejoined dubiously, “it
isn’t quite that; but she always seems to
have engagements or something. She must
always 'be going now,’ and she’s altered
so. I told her so, and she said we were
silly then; and if I muff this match it will
be worse than ever.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I couldn’t help thinking that if I had
organised the female mind I should have
done it more consistently; but then there
would probably have been no comedy in
the world. I was willing to help Ted all I
could, and advised a spontaneous gaiety in
her presence—Ted shook his head—or failing
that, a desperate counter-movement
with a married woman; a notion he also
rejected.</p>

<p class='c012'>The only suggestion Ted had to make
was that I should go to the match, contrive
to sit next to Miss Nell, and—what, he
didn’t say; a delicate reserve I admired.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’re a good chap, you know, Butterfield,”
he added. “I’ve told lots of our fellows
what a good chap you are. Harrop
major says so too—he met you once, you
know, Butterfield.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I fear I had forgotten Harrop major in
the multiplicity of my affairs, but I was
properly touched. I smiled at my own
goodness.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, thanks awfully, Butterfield”—he
rose to go—“it’s awfully good of you really.
You’re a brick.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thanks, Ted,” I returned. “I hope
you’ll come off all right in the match.”</p>

<p class='c012'>His lips twitched queerly; I forbore to
press the alternative contingency, and he
took his leave.</p>

<p class='c012'>My duty, apparently, was to keep an eye
on Miss Nell, to diagnose her condition
when Ted went in to bat, to mark how, as
should befall, his success or failure was received,
and to exercise a discretionary supervision
over the state of her heart as revealed
by the vicissitudes of the game. It was
doubtful of what precise use I should be,
but—it was interesting, and Ted was a
pleasant-mannered youth.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was peculiarly interesting in view of
the fact that the Carmichaels were a cricketing
family. Now the purely abstract part
of the game was a cult to which I had never
aspired, my only interest being in such
personal cases as that of my young friend
Ted. I was convinced that the progress of
Carmichael senior’s love, if it had had a
progress, was accelerated by the fact that
he had, in <i>his</i> Eton match, made fifty on
a wet wicket; and the question whether a
similar performance on the son’s part would
please Nellie, or whether Nellie would be
merely pleased to see Ted pleased with
himself, was a speculation which I followed
into the nicer nuances.</p>

<p class='c012'>Our party accounted for a considerable
segment of bench space, the apex of which,
I contrived it, consisted of Miss Nell and
myself. We were backed by tiers of Carmichaels,
Chattertons, and Bassishaws, and
penetrated wedge-wise into half a division
of Eton younglings, with close-cropped hair
and large ears, which looked frank admiration
at Nellie. One keeper of the public
manners with freckles and an even greater
extent of white collar than the rest cuffed
his neighbour for saying that she was stunning.
Nellie heard and laughed. She sat
provokingly upright, and shot enfilading
glances to left and right beneath the brim of
a hat remarkably adapted to such proceedings.
A pretty, slim thing she was, and the
careless white flash between her lips unsettled
Ted considerably, who was paying
uneasy flying visits.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think the Harrow boys <i>look</i> nicer,”
she said, with a look of illicit pleasure from
the shade of that eminently suitable hat;
and Ted left with ill-feigned unconcern. I
remembered my mission, and leaned towards
her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nellie,” I said, “do you consider that an
encouraging remark to a young man whose
happiness depends on his playing a straight
bat and keeping his head cool?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Ted’s all right,” she returned with,
I was pleased to observe, a touch of shame;
“besides, what does it matter? It’s only a
game.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She might have had her answer from the
group of Eton juvenility surrounding us,
which broke into excited babble.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, you can.” “No, you can’t.” “You
can’t be caught off your pads. Fat lot you
know about cricket.” “Silly ass.” And
so forth.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But, Mr. Butterfield,” she said after a
moment, “he will be so unbearable if he
makes a lot of runs. He’s important
enough already at being in the eleven.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She stooped and spoke to young Eton on
her right, who blushed at the distinction,
but answered with bashful coldness.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Besides,” she continued, “they say his
average is thirty, and I’m sure I don’t care
who wins.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Luckily this treasonable utterance was
unheard by the Eton boys, with whom sentiment
and cricket hung in highly disproportionate
balance. I was satisfied, at least,
that if it came to the worst she would be
sorry for Ted.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now, Eton batted first, and there was
little talk in our strongly prejudiced
quarter. Ted Carmichael, I gathered from
my neighbours, was to go in “third wicket
down.” He had made a last visit—this
time from a different entrance—but had
avoided Nell, sitting next to Bassishaw instead,
who had not tried to talk to him.
Then he had disappeared.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c012'>I knew in my soul what was going to
happen. Ted’s nervousness at his first
match, and the condescending interest of
Miss Nellie Bassishaw, could only have one
result; and I was so busy speculating on
the mysteries of this dread fatality that
hems us so remorselessly about, that I forgot
the scene for a moment, and was startled
back by the juvenile clamour. The inevitable
had happened.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh!” “Oh, I say!” “What a trimmer!”
“Just on the bails!” “First ball!”
“—broke from the off!” “It didn’t—it
was a straight ball.” “Four for fifty-three.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Ted was out, for a duck.</p>

<p class='c012'>I glanced at the slender white figure
trailing a fruitless bat towards the pavilion,
and adjusted the knees of my trousers.
I commented mentally on the pattern, and
waited.</p>

<p class='c012'>She did not speak, but absently pulled
off a glove. The Carmichaels behind
slowly resumed their talk, and the Eton
boys, after marking their scoring cards,
took up the current of the game. True
liberals, with them the issue transcended
the individual.</p>

<p class='c012'>Still she did not speak, but folded and
unfolded the gloves. I glanced up, and
that eminently becoming hat did not seem
the same, so inseparably had it been connected
with the lurking ambuscade of
eyes. Miss Nell was visibly shaken.</p>

<p class='c012'>I leaned towards her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s only a game, Nellie——” I began.
She interrupted me with a look.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Please don’t be mean, Mr. Butterfield.
I know what you think—you think it’s all
my fault.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I was silent for Ted’s sake, and she continued
slowly:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t see why men should think so
much of cricket. It makes them so——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“So unbearable when they come off,”
I replied. “But he must have been very
nervous, Nellie, whether or no. You
couldn’t help that. Your encouragement
would probably have disturbed him just
as much as your—as not. That is the
double influence of woman on the man of
action—neither her smiles nor her frowns
help him in the least. Her approval is
pleasant when it’s all over, but I’m afraid
the presence of the Queen of Love and
Beauty has unhorsed many a gallant youth
before to-day. He makes the mistake
in——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“In having anything to do with them?”
she queried with pretty cynicism.</p>

<p class='c012'>I leaned back.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No. In being a man of action,” I returned.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a sudden turn and hush among
the Eton boys. Ted reappeared, and they
were awed in the presence of a great grief.
He sat down next to me with the hard look
of one who asks no sympathy, folded his
hands, and stared at his shoes. The Eton
boys whispered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And they play me for my batting,” he
said, so softly that I scarcely heard. “I’m a
bat—a bat. I’m here to make runs.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Weltschmerz had sunk into his soul.
I was about to say something, but checked
myself as Nellie bent forward.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ted,” she said, “I’m so sorry. It’s all
my fault.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I folded my arms, looking before me.
Ted did not move an inch.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I was horrid,” she continued, “and I
pretended——”</p>

<p class='c012'>She stopped, conscious of the significance
of what she was about to say. She had
pretended to be unconscious of her empire
over his heart, and was now retracting.
Miss Nellie is the modern girl, with whom
proposal is unnecessary.</p>

<p class='c012'>Ted cut her short with the brutality of
male desperation.</p>

<p class='c012'>“All right, Nellie,” he said curtly. “It’s
not your fault. I drank brandy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This was a surprise to me. Brandy
steadies the nerves, but it is a remedy not
recommended by the captains of cricket
elevens, and his boyish devilry, as training,
was as reprehensible as it was in the spirit
of the comedy. But Nellie saw further
than Ted.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Ted,” she said humbly, “and that
is my fault too. I made you angry. Will
you forgive me?”</p>

<p class='c012'>It has always seemed to me that when a
pretty, half-tearful creature asks you if you
will forgive her, the question is beside the
mark, the forgiveness not depending on
whether you will or not. You are not
willing; you would much rather not; but—you
do precisely as Ted did; he squeezed
her ungloved hand across my knee, and an
Eton boy sniggered.</p>

<p class='c012'>I don’t know why I should have experienced
a sensation as near akin to
jealousy as I can locate it. I pursued the
moral labyrinth for a time, and, getting no
nearer, was fain to come to earth.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And the next innings, Ted——” Nellie
was saying.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alas! What then? What, in Ted’s
words, had women, even Queens of Love
and Beauty, to do with cricket? More
subtle in their influence than the forbidden
brandy, why do not the captains demand
that their followers shall be bachelors
unattached? Ted was too blessedly happy
to know; certainly too happy to be let
alone. I spoke for his own good.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The next innings,” I remarked, “will
exemplify the second stage of the female
relation to the man of action.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I don’t think either of them took the
trouble to understand.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch12' class='c013'>XII <br /> <br />A MODERN SABINE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, that’s the trouble. We’re all far
too complex nowadays.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We live in a complex age,” I returned
profoundly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“True, very true,” he replied, and
twisted the ribbon of his eyeglass round
one finger. “Very little is left that is
simple and primitive and beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I favoured him with the cosmic shrug of
his cult, and said nothing eloquently. The
understanding was complete.</p>

<p class='c012'>Cicely Vicars’s “evening” was ground
I had not hitherto explored, and I had
marked for my own at once the young man
drooping mincingly over the piano. He
was smooth and fair, inclined to premature
stoutness, and looked remotely. Mrs.
Vicars informed me that he was a playwright,
a dramatic critic, and a Fashion;
that he promised brilliant things, and that
the name under which he wrought was
Eleanor Macquoid. She added that he had
intuition beyond his years.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now people went to Mrs. Vicars’s “evening”
for intellectual intercourse and the
exchange of ideas—an object in which they
would not be balked. Carrie had said as
much to me.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You ought to come, Rol,” she had remarked
on one occasion. “It’s so—it’s
awfully new, Rol, really.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Indeed?” I had said. “In what way
is it particularly—pardon me—up to
date?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh,” she replied, “it’s so <i>real</i>, Rollo.”
Then, reassuringly, “They don’t talk about
the soul, you know—you needn’t be afraid
of that. It’s—it’s instinct. The soul is
quite too old, you know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A full season behind,” I assented
gravely. “And so the soul, <i>chez</i> Mrs.
Vicars, is superseded in favour of the
dilettante animal? Is that so, my sister?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” she agreed doubtfully, and added,
“Of course there are outsiders.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It turned out, as Caroline had said, to be
Instinct, Primal Sanity, and the Elemental
Paganism, and very prettily put I heard it.
No one was <i>blasé</i>. They said so. They
were enthusiastic. My young man declared
it with an animation that brought him near
to spilling the liqueur carefully poised on
his knee. He spoke of the keen joy of living,
delicately and epigrammatically, digressing
to observe that he preferred Indian cigarettes
to Brazilian, and adding that after all
there was nothing like the great rough kindnesses
of the Mother Earth. Cicely Vicars’s
gathering was indisputably in the vanguard
of the latest cry.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Eleanor Macquoid seemed to take to
me, for he spoke almost immediately of
“people who understand.” I was evidently
admitted on sight to the mystery, and improved
the occasion accordingly. I examined
my finger nails—I had seen him do
so—and dropped my pearls of wisdom nonchalantly,
as not expecting they would be
gathered up.</p>

<p class='c012'>He was talking softly, and almost sleepily,
on the picturesqueness of Mass and
Brute Bulk.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There is something quite Titanic,” he
said, “in the conception of a world where
nothing was as yet ruled and squared out
for us; where everything was vague and
shifting.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is an especially gigantic thought,”
I replied appreciatively. “The insistence
nowadays of the Social Nexus——”</p>

<p class='c012'>I paused, and he nodded comprehendingly
at the cue.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” he replied, “that also is true.
Ah, if it were only possible to escape from
the bewildering system into the clean fields
and the rain-washed heather——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“To evade the ever-present Self, and to
take refuge in the great unhewn passions?”
I queried gently.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Exactly,” he replied, again carefully
contemplating his nails, “to know again
the crude and volcanic life. Everything
is tertiary in these days—we have no primaries.
Nothing rude or red.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I forbore to challenge the remark as to
rudeness, and agreed that from my observation
it hardly appeared to be an age of
epics. He approved, passing his hand over
his sleek, clean hair.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And yet,” he continued, judicially
weighing each word, and turning to the
nails of the other hand, “and yet—why?
Why should we, the heirs of the centuries,
be in reality the slaves of them? Why
should we not love, for instance, as the
rugged, forgotten ones loved? Why should
we love through the post-office and by
chaperonage—through engagements and
marriages? Why should we not——”</p>

<p class='c012'>He forbore to say what, and sighed, apparently
for the days when he might have
loved with a stone axe in untracked forests
and through rivers in flood. I offered him
a cigarette.</p>

<p class='c012'>He lighted it, and gazing before him as
though he were culling a nascent thought
from the smoke, went on slowly and prophetically.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nevertheless,” he said, more softly than
ever, “the strong man shall come; and
when he shall appear—the man for whom
we are waiting—the man who shall break
the bonds and go back—back——”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a characteristic of most of his
sentences that he finished them by watching
the films of smoke before him. This
time he made a remarkably perfect smoke
ring. I thought of Caroline, and wondered
what she was doing in such a <i>milieu</i>.</p>

<p class='c012'>I was fain to speak.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And what form of creative expression
do you adopt, Mr. Macquoid?” I asked
gracefully.</p>

<p class='c012'>He replied with a modest diffidence:</p>

<p class='c012'>“The drama. One is but a mouthpiece—a
medium; yet the speech from living
lips with the living person before the
eyes——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are doubtless right,” I replied;
“words are unconvincing; things must be
seen to be believed.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He noticed nothing, and proceeded to
speak of the modern French chansonette.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now Caroline, I remembered, had, before
her engagement, accounted for a large
portion of her time in putting together the
materials for a comedy, which, however,
she had since discontinued under the somewhat
exclusive demands of courtship. I
had never been privileged to see the work
in question, but understood that a knotty
proposal scene had, coincidentally, been
abandoned precisely at the time that she
could, had she wished, have given it an
autobiographical interest. Bassishaw’s
love, besides interrupting the course of art,
bade fair to cut it off altogether just when
it would have given the true note that the
stage, it is declared, is aching for. But
even young authors have scruples in making
their own affairs public, and so Caroline
had willed it.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nevertheless, it could do Caroline no
harm to meet Mr. Eleanor Macquoid; and
Mr. Macquoid himself could do no less
than accept resignedly the latter-day limitations
of love in the presence of my sister.
After all, Mrs. Vicars’s salon was for
the interchange of ideas.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My sister,” I remarked, “is interested
in the drama, and has herself half-realised
aspirations in the way of comedy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Macquoid would be charmed; and I
presented him. I was called away for a
few moments by Mrs. Vicars. By the
time I returned Mr. Macquoid was talking,
his remarks being apparently directed
to the point at which Caroline’s comedy
had been relinquished.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is difficult,” he observed, with a
polite interest, “to know what to do with
one’s young leads nowadays. I suppose
they must love—the Philistine still clings
to the conventional love-theme—but it is
all so stale. In the old days it was different.”</p>

<p class='c012'>From the angle of Caroline’s chin I saw
that it was anything but stale to her, and
that the remark was unfortunate. She
was evidently of opinion that the subject
of love, however much used, had had anything
but adequate treatment, and that in
one or two important respects she was in
a position to direct a new light on the
literary treatment of it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What do you mean, Mr. Macquoid?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Merely,” he replied casually, “that
there is so little dash and—and high-handedness
about our modern methods of love-making.
You get your couples together,
and they talk in the same weary way—the
same old flat talk, talk, talk——”</p>

<p class='c012'>I smiled at the description as applied to
Bassishaw, whose fluency was not remarkable,
and Caroline looked coldly before
her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You refer to the stage, Mr. Macquoid?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I refer to modern love-making,” he
replied rashly. “We have no romantic
methods left. It has become a business
and a bore. When we do get it out it’s
one kiss and thank Heaven it’s over.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Caroline looked emphatic contradiction.
I interposed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Roman soldiery, it is related,” I
said, “being once in want of wives——”</p>

<p class='c012'>Caroline interrupted me quickly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think, Mr. Macquoid,” she returned,
“that people love just as passionately
nowadays as they ever did.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He might have seen what was the matter,
but he was on his own subject, and
went blindly at it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“True,” he replied, “true. But the
surroundings, the circumstances, the littleness
of everyday life—they crush it out.
We love by rule and etiquette, at social
functions and in gas-lit drawing-rooms.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I looked at Caroline for a confirmation
of Bassishaw’s methods, but the personal
equation was too much for her contemplation
of the artistic side of the
question.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course we do, Mr. Macquoid,” she
returned, waiving, it seemed to me, the
part that had to do with the gas. “What
else can we do?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Eleanor Macquoid raised his eyebrows
and shoulders in a deferential gesture
that was supposed to explain the way.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The wind still blows,” he said, “the
rain, the open air——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The parks,” I suggested, “are already——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“—but,” he continued, “we wear frock-coats
and carry umbrellas. We marry,
and our children resume the same hopeless
round. There is no romance, no
poetry, no heroism in it. We become engaged
for a certain period to please our
friends, and marry out of consideration
for one another. We have no impulse, no
real instinct. We have no—no militant
love.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He seemed to receive a fresh start from
the last phrase, and, alas! ruined himself
irretrievably.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why,” he exclaimed, “even those to
whom we might look for a vigorous expression
of it—those who lead lives of adventurous
excitement—our soldiers and sailors—are
just as bad. As you remarked, Mr.
Butterfield, the Roman soldiers——”</p>

<p class='c012'>The social system might be attacked, disintegrated,
and shown wanting in the eyes
of amateur modern paganism; the spirit of
the age might be arraigned and condemned
by twenty juries of the advanced salons;
modish culture might stalk hock-deep in
the wreckage of civilisation; but—to Caroline
the prestige of the army was vested
in the person of Bassishaw. Bassishaw’s
mode of love-making had been compared to
its disfavour with the practices of Roman
legions.</p>

<p class='c012'>She raised her head disdainfully without
glancing at the unconscious Mr. Eleanor
Macquoid, spoke half over her shoulder,
and condemned a great nation in Bassishaw’s
defence.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t think very highly, Mr. Macquoid,
of the Romans. I think that when
they—that on that occasion at least—they
were horrid, and—and—unnecessarily
rough, and that nice people would never
have done it. It may make good pictures,
but one would rather be a pleasant
person than an unpleasant picture. And
I don’t care a bit what anybody says;
soldiers are just as good as—anybody
else.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And better, beyond comparison better,
her shoulders seemed to say as she turned
away. Macquoid shifted his other elbow
to the piano, and then looked at me.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am afraid, Mr. Butterfield, that I have
not been able to help your sister much in
the play. After all, the real impulse must
come from within.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is,” I replied, “a pleasing reticence
when the real impulse stays there. The
self-sacrifice imposed by art is not necessarily
a sacrifice of one’s self.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very true,” he answered approvingly,
and took coffee.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch13' class='c013'>XIII <br /> <br />POT LUCK</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Do you know, Butterfield,” Bassishaw
said, “I don’t know how you get along—that
is—get along, you know—as you
do.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The remark didn’t seem particularly
illuminating, but he had been silent for
ten minutes, and this appeared to be the
result of his cogitation.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No?” I said encouragingly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, you know what I mean,” he
replied. “I mean how you manage—in
the way you do, you know; never to—you’ve
never—hang it, Butterfield, why
don’t you get married?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh!” I answered, “I see. Of course.
I didn’t quite catch the idea at first. Of
course. Why don’t I get married.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” he replied, much relieved. “You—you
should, you know. It’s the finest
thing in the world—being engaged, that
is. You’ve no idea, really, Butterfield.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He seemed quite eager about it. I put
my feet comfortably on the fender, and
waited for him to expand. He kept his
eyes on the fire.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You know,” he went on slowly, “you’ll
feel awfully lonely and all that—soon,
that is—when Caroline goes, I mean.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Matchmaking is never a man’s line; he
draws back at the very intimate point he
should press home. Arthur did his best.
Mrs. Loring had probably been talking to
him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I shall miss her very much,” I replied,
“very much indeed; but to whom do you
propose to marry me?”</p>

<p class='c012'>He seemed rather abashed, and a trifle
impatient.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t be an ass,” he said.</p>

<p class='c012'>I could not be certain, owing to the
firelight, that he blushed, but I chanced it.
I didn’t object to these palpable attempts
to marry me to Millicent Dixon; but it
was disparaging to my intelligence that I
should be supposed not to notice them.
Anyway, the male element was a new
feature in the alliance.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And do you think that she and I
would be a well-matched pair?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>He professed a hypocritical ignorance as
to whom I meant. I laughed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mrs. Loring,” I answered, “can give
you points, Arthur. You would apparently
marry me on general principles.
She particularises.”</p>

<p class='c012'>We were waiting for Caroline and
Millicent. Millicent and Bassishaw were
dining with us that evening, and Bassishaw
had lately, I knew, been a good deal
perturbed on my account. More than
once he had timidly suggested that a
woman’s hand in a place made all the
difference, you know, and I had caught
him glancing round my rooms with something
of a disparaging valuation of their
contents when he should take Caroline
away. His friendly concern, in itself, was
deserving of my gratitude—but with this
qualification, that I don’t believe he was
above suspecting that I should take to
drink in the imminent solitude of my
bereft apartments.</p>

<p class='c012'>I was extracting from him the fervent
declaration that I couldn’t imagine how
splendid It—being engaged—made you
feel, and that to know that there was
One upon whom et-cetera et-cetera For
Ever, when Millicent and Caroline entered.
We rose to greet them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How do you do, Millicent?” I said.
“I’m glad to see you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Heaven!” she replied, “let me come
near the fire. I’m as cold as a seminary
breakfast. How do you do, Arthur?
What a blessed blaze! Don’t go away,
Arthur.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Bassishaw had gone over to the table,
where Caroline was making the last unnecessary
arrangements, and was having his
flower pinned on.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! his circulation’s all right,” I remarked.
“We were once like that,” and
Millicent, looking over her shoulder,
laughed at me, and said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“The dear infants!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dinner was served, and we took our
places. I faced Caroline, while Millicent,
who was still chilly, and didn’t mind the
fire at her back, looked over the flowers
at Bassishaw; an arrangement as can be
diagrammatically proved, offering facilities
for between-deck pressing of feet on
a diagonal plan, and which appeared to
suit my young sister admirably. I gave
her an amused glance, which Millicent intercepted,
and Carrie tried, unsuccessfully,
to look as if she hadn’t done it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Never mind him, Carrie,” Millicent said
reassuringly. “He’s an envious old man,
who’s wasted his youth, and he’s getting
cynical. His failing years won’t permit
him to do such things himself, and his conscience
begins to hurt him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This was the woman without whom, in
Bassishaw’s opinion, my abode fell short of
completeness.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My failing years, Miss Dixon,” I returned,
“bring with them a certain charity;
nevertheless, allow me to point out
your reason for condoning such practices.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Which is——?” she queried.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That you are quite capable of doing
the same thing yourself.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She laughed, and Bassishaw looked puzzled.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, I’m not tottering to my fall yet,”
she retorted. “I have all sorts of little
surprises in my blood.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You forbid reply, Miss Dixon,” I answered.
“You take refuge in a position
where man can only maintain a respectful
and incredulous silence. A woman’s
years——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“——are——?” she challenged.</p>

<p class='c012'>“——and an income-tax return——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am beneath your roof, Mr. Butterfield,”
she replied, with the dignity of St.
James’s comedy.</p>

<p class='c012'>Caroline evidently disapproved strongly.
She caught my eye.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t think you’re a bit nice this
evening, Rollo,” she said. “If I were
Millicent”—she straightened her back—“I
wouldn’t dine with you. Don’t take any
notice of him, Millie dear.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Perhaps,” I replied, “the disparity in
years is too great. Think so, Bassishaw?”</p>

<p class='c012'>I looked round the flowers at him. He
seemed rather embarrassed, and said nothing.
I filled Millicent’s glass, and turned
to her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What do you think Bassishaw was
saying to me just before you came in?”</p>

<p class='c012'>I received a kick. Bassishaw, behind
the flowers, was very red indeed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Heaven forbid that I should guess!”
Millicent replied. “Men are frail creatures.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He was speaking,” I continued, “of
women as a domestic institution. No
home, he said, was complete without one.
Considered decoratively, she gave an air of
brightness——”</p>

<p class='c012'>Bassishaw must have been as busy in
his pedipulations as an organist, for Caroline
peremptorily held out her glass to be
replenished. I continued:</p>

<p class='c012'>“As a companion, he said, much could
be forgiven her. And she had admirable
managing gifts.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Millicent bowed across the flowers.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The sex thanks you, Arthur,” she said.
“It is quite the proper point of view for a
young man. As for this belated bachelor,”—myself—“he
never did, nor ever will,
think rightly on the subject.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Bassishaw looked at me reproachfully.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I didn’t mean—what you think I
meant,” he said uncomfortably.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Forgive me. You meant much more
than I say I think you meant.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I meant—I meant——” he replied; and
then, apologetically, “well, you <i>are</i> getting
on, you know, and you’ve missed so much,
really, Rollo. If you <i>like</i> being alone——A
man who’s never—you don’t mind my
saying it?—well, he doesn’t know, that’s
all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Bassishaw subsided rather incoherently,
but applied himself to his plate with conviction.
I looked at Millicent, who glanced
sidelong fun under her lids.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What you say is perfectly convincing
as a proposition, Arthur,” she remarked.
“The man who’s Never—never does know;
but the application is another matter.
From report, there were hopes for Rollo
Butterfield that he has failed to justify.
He flirted notoriously.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thank you, gracious lady,” I replied
complacently, leaning back at my ease.
“That is the name the world gives it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your conduct with Dolly Hemingway
was shameless.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Marriage would certainly have been an
illogical conclusion,” I admitted.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And Violet Mellish told me herself——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dear little Vi,” I approved. “Her
conversation never did lack the relish of
revelation. You must not suppose, Arthur,
that I have not had the normal past that
my years would guarantee. You appear to
think so.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Bassishaw didn’t seem to see it at all.
He fumbled with his fork.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I expect you’ve had your fancies, of
course,” he replied. “But I don’t mean
just fancies—that’s only flirting.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The man who cannot flirt never sees that
the power to do so is a gift of the gods.
Arthur held by negative constancy.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Flirtation,” I replied, “is not the simple
affair you think, Arthur. It is not necessarily
a matter of twilights and conservatories,
and does not even always demand
privacy. For a flirtation with zest there is
nothing like having an audience. Is that
not so, Millicent?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Spare me the revelation of my ignorance,”
Millicent returned, moving her chair
an inch or two from the now importunate
fire, and looking over her shoulder. “It is
possible.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The only requisites are a woman, a
secret, and as many spectators as have not
the use of their eyes,” I continued; “those
granted, you may riot in innuendo, and your
reputation go scatheless. It is the very
button on the cap.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Bassishaw could think of nothing more
original to say than that it was playing
with edged tools. Carrie was directing the
removal of plates; I devoted my attention
to Millicent.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I had one very serious fancy, though,
Millicent,” I remarked. “Shall I tell
you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I trust it is not unfit for the children,”
she replied, looking this time beneath the
flowers at Bassishaw. “The knowledge of
good and evil from your point of view might
not be of advantage to them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Caroline looked round curiously.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Rollo, what was that?” she said.
“You never told me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No?” I inquired incredulously. “And
you my sister, too! Ah, well, it was this.
Summer mornings, at seven, I used to go
across the fields with a bathing-towel; on
my return I was generally met by—I never
mentioned her name.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It would be indiscreet,” said Millicent.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Discretion,” I answered, “is the better
part of flirtation. They were lovely mornings,
and there was a stile—a rather high
stile—a distinct opportunity.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I looked carefully away from Millicent,
and turned to Bassishaw.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes?” he said appreciatively. “And
what happened?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I fancy,” I continued, “that she always
met me on my side of the stile, so that we
always had to get over it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Bassishaw seemed to approve the strategy.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nice girl?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“She combined,” I replied, “the harmlessness
of the dove with the wisdom of the
serpent, for she used to feel tired when we
got there, and rest. There was just room
for two.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Caroline was interested.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And when was this, Rollo?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My dear Carrie,” I returned, “you had
just begun German; you were at school.
Well, this woman of mine would pull a
flower to pieces, or light a cigarette for me,
or some such foolishness. She knew the
exact distance at which her hair would
touch my face if it were a little tumbled.
And so on.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Millicent made the criticism that the
least she could have done under the
circumstances was to have sprained her
ankle.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And who was it?” Carrie asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='c012'>The woman who presumed to condemn
my carrying-on with Dolly Hemingway
and Violet Mellish sat smiling in frank
innocence. She, whose ignorance of such
matters was to be scrupulously respected,
sat with unconsciousness on her brow, and
gave graceful attention to my story. She,
who had called me a belated bachelor, who
had spoken of my failing years and my
perspective of hesitating singleness, and,
above all, whose memory needed no hint as
to what I was going to say, dissembled
without a quiver.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who was it?” Caroline repeated.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The name is the least essential part of
the affair,” I replied. “We are concerned
with the stile.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, the stile,” Millicent said. “What
happened?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Were she to ask me herself, I should
only whisper,” I returned.</p>

<p class='c012'>She leaned back and laughed outright.
“You are too considerate on her account
to make the story very interesting,” she remarked.
“I swear I could finish it better
myself. One day you tried to kiss her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Millicent had chosen the hazardous line
of safety. She had told the truth.</p>

<p class='c012'>I stole a glance at her under cover of
the flowers.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I tried not to,” I replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And she was angry.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“She did her best to be angry.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“She was.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Till the next morning,” I answered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And then you begged her pardon?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I did nothing of the kind. I was not
so young as all that.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But, at least, you were sorry?” Millicent
suggested.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not from that day to this,” I replied.
“It was too perfect.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Millicent moved her chair a little further,
and, as she did so—it might have been
done purposely—you never can tell with
Millicent—her foot touched mine gently;
and as it remained there a moment, I felt
more like Bassishaw than I would have
cared to admit. She has since told me, I
don’t mind saying, that I have good eyes;
be that as it may, the mischief in her own
was for a second tempered to an expression
that—was nobody’s business but mine. I
felt tempted to forswear my theory, and to
regret the presence of an audience.</p>

<p class='c012'>She rose gaily.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This is all very well,” she said, “but it
is a bad thing to have the fire at your back.
Be good enough to put the screen up,
Arthur.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Arthur did so.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But the story,” Caroline persisted
impatiently—she wanted to get to the
reconciliation with tears. “How does the
story go on?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It went on,” I replied, “in much the
same way. It is not quite finished yet.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She looked a virtuous reproof.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am surprised, Rollo,” she said, “that
you should have behaved in so indiscreet
a fashion. I think that on that occasion it
was just as well there <i>was</i> nobody there.
<i>I</i> should be exceedingly sorry to witness
any such proceeding. It would make me
extremely uncomfortable.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I laughed, and stroked my little sister’s
hair.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What liqueur will you take, Millicent?”
I asked.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch14' class='c013'>XIV <br /> <br />THE THINGS THAT ARE CÆSAR’S</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Almost the whole of my female acquaintance
seemed to be gathered in my
rooms, and seemed, moreover, to be doing
its collective best to persuade me of the
superfluity of my presence. The occasion
was the eve of Caroline’s wedding, and
the natural interest I myself took in the
event paled before the engrossing fascination
it appeared to have for these ladies.
The company consisted largely of Mrs.
Loring Chatterton; but she was ably supported
by the remainder of her particular
set and half a dozen supernumerary bridesmaids,
not one of whom—with the exception,
perhaps, of a quiet little creature who
sat apart and said nothing—but would
willingly have turned me out of house and
home had she dared, as a person who could
perfectly well be dispensed with. From
the whispered conversations and secret conferences
around me I was rigidly excluded,
which I regretted the more as I felt I
should have taken a peculiar pleasure in
them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My good man,” said Mrs. Loring,
striding over my feet with an armful of
bridesmaids’ frippery, “what a lot of room
you take up! You are sure you have no
engagement this evening?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nothing of importance, Mrs. Loring,”
I replied, looking up from an entry-book
of bridal gifts I was curiously scanning,
with mental notes of my own. “You may
consider me entirely at your disposal. My
duty is here to-night of all nights; and
when you and Mrs. Carmichael can spare
Caroline, I also have certain advice to give
her not inappropriate to the occasion.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t you think you’d better go and
give Arthur the benefit of your wisdom?”
she rejoined.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Alas,” I replied, “it is too late—he
cannot draw back now. He must take the
inevitable consequences of engagement.
He has made his bed——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I see no reason for your being indelicate,
Mr. Butterfield,” answered Mrs. Chatterton;
and she rustled away, dignity in flounces.</p>

<p class='c012'>Never had my flat known such wealth of
plate and tissue-paper. Had Jupiter, in
wooing Danaë, adopted a silver currency,
he could scarce have crowded more lavishly
the Grecian tower. Ladies slipped
in and out of the miscellaneous collection
with feminine calculations and judgments,
which I noted in secret joy, estimating, apparently,
the whole affair in its comparison
with previous functions. And above all,
and more insistent from their very quietness,
were heard the mysterious confabulations.</p>

<p class='c012'>I crossed over to Mrs. Carmichael and
Caroline. “Well, little sister,” I said, glancing
at Mrs. Carmichael, “and what unspeakable
things has Mrs. Kit been telling you
now?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Rollo,” she replied, placing her
hand pleadingly on my sleeve, “she hasn’t.
Please don’t tease me to-night, dear. I am
not a bit happy. I almost wish I was not
going to be married.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then she has?” I returned. “Mrs.
Kit, how could you? But there—you’re
all alike. They’re not in the least interested
in you, Carrie, my dear. It’s just a wedding.
A woman and a bridecake——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What do you know about it?” Mrs.
Carmichael said disdainfully.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Madame,” I replied, “the exultation of
your sex in all that pertains to a wedding
is barely fit for the contemplation of a
bachelor. Cannot you disguise your interest
in some seemly manner?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“If you’ll arrange these cards,” she retorted,
“instead of concerning yourself with
things of no moment to you, you’ll be of
much more service. <i>Will</i> you be so good
as to label these presents—and with as
little talk as is convenient to you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>This to me, mind, in my own house!
I looked to Caroline to espouse my cause
and to resent the outrage on my feelings;
but she merely looked plaintively. With
a sigh, which Mrs. Kit, calling after me,
qualified as “avoirdupois,” I tried Mrs.
Vicars, who was fluttering round the other
end of the glittering table, arranging the
nuptial tribute in symphonic harmonies
of the Kensington amateur order. Mrs.
Vicars is æsthetic at a street’s length, and,
as Millicent Dixon had once spitefully said,
wears her art upon her sleeves for Jays to
laugh at. She was placing her own offering,
something in plush and oil colour,
modestly, shrinkingly, all but out of
sight.</p>

<p class='c012'>I was saying something about the spiritual
reality of which all this external show
was but the outward symbol, when she cut
me off.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Mr. Butterfield,” she said, “why
<i>did</i> Cissie Bingham give Caroline a <i>green</i>
fan?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Possibly, Mrs. Vicars,” I replied, “for
the same order of reason that causes a
miller to wear a white hat.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But a green one—how horrid! Look
at her complexion!” And she bent the
trifle coquettishly round her chin, with a
well-studied sparkle over the top of it—a
lesson in feminine Arts and Crafts.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A fan, Mrs. Vicars,” I replied, “may be
used either for flirtation or concealment—before
marriage. Afterwards, only for the
latter. In either case the appropriateness——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think you are very horrid, Mr. Butterfield,”
she answered, preening the openwork
effervescence of her corsage and turning
her shoulders to me in pique. “I believe
Mrs. Bassishaw wants you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I tried my luck with Mrs. Bassishaw,
Arthur’s mother. Mrs. Bassishaw is a
comely widow, as young as is compatible
with having a son on the eve of marriage,
and still possessing what her friends call
“excellent chances.” She made a place for
me by her side.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You and I will be less in the way in
this corner, Mr. Butterfield,” she said, “and
we can watch the young people. Doesn’t
this make you feel terribly old? I declare
I feel myself ageing already.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She passed her hand over her glossy
hair.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I also feel it keenly, Mrs. Bassishaw,” I
replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And only think, Mr. Butterfield,” she
continued, “should—should you become an
uncle, I shall be a grandmother! Oh, I do
hope they’ll be comfortable—and happy!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have not a doubt, Mrs. Bassishaw,” I
answered, “that they will be exceedingly
comfortable—and becomingly happy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Only that?” she inquired.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is not that a good deal?” I replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They are, I believe, made for each
other; but I do not expect anything epic
from either of them, nor will they, so far
as I can see, mark the beginning of an æon
in the annals of matrimony.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are very hard on them, Mr. Butterfield—poor
things!” she answered—apparently
because I had not granted them the
beginning of an æon. Thus does one suffer
for principle! I rose to interview an automatic
reporter from a fashion paper, whom
Mrs. Loring handed over to me with a request
to be good enough to take the thing
seriously. I told him that the presents
were numerous and costly, including—here
followed a list; and crossed over to a knot
of frolicking bridesmaids that was gabbling
millinery in one corner.</p>

<p class='c012'>These young ladies had apparently a
good deal to say; and prominent among
the chatter could be heard Miss Nellie
Bassishaw’s voice declaring that something
or other of hers was of a poorer quality of
silk than some one else’s; which was always
the way, she remarked, with a grown-up
toss of the head, when one bought six gowns
at the same shop. Miss Flo Bassishaw and
another maid were talking simultaneously,
the one saying that the organist was sure to
play the march too soulfully for it to be of
much use as walking music, and the other
that old——(a respected friend of mine)
could afford to give cheap salad bowls now
that he had married all his daughters. And
above all, and to an extent that was an
enlightenment even to me, the pairing
arrangements for the breakfast were discussed
with a freedom and pointedness that
took entire precedence of any other significance
the occasion might have. In this
theme again Miss Nellie revelled.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t care,” she said, “I shall ask
Carrie. He’s not a bit too old; and I
<i>have</i> met him before—you haven’t. I’m
not going to be bored to death by Jack
Somers, and have to do all the talking myself;
and that’s my decision,” she said
irrevocably.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We shall have <i>our</i> hair up to-morrow,
too,” returned Flo, with the spiteful
familiarity of a younger sister, “and I
shall hear every word you say, because
I shall be on the other side.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know why they ask such a
crowd,” another half-blown bud of sixteen
joined in. “I expect Rollo Butterfield
went to school with most of them—they’re
old enough.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And fat enough—and dull enough—and
bald enough—the poise of her chin
seemed to say. I admired her confidence.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And what about——?” a nod of Miss
Nellie’s head gave the direction to my
eyes. I looked, and saw apparently
unheeded by the noisy group, the pretty,
timid creature I had remarked once or
twice before, an imported cousin of somebody’s,
condemned to wear pink because
it suited the rest. She was out in the
cold; but something in the abstracted
quietness of her pose told me it was
perhaps as much from choice as from the
passing-over of her companions.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh,” Miss Flo replied, “she can go
somewhere near Rollo Butterfield—she’ll
be less awkward near him than with anybody
else. And then Jack Somers.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Seeing myself so allotted, I thought it
well to make the acquaintance beforehand
of the maid for whose conversational flow
I was to be responsible. I skirted the
group, and sat down by her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I see you’re taking a short rest from
your duties, Aggie,” I remarked. “Are
you having a good time?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, thank you, Mr. Butterfield,”
she answered shyly. “I think it’s all
lovely.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The dresses and things?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” she replied, turning grey eyes
upon me. “Mr. Bassishaw and the
wedding—and Caroline. The presents
don’t matter much, do they, Mr. Butterfield?”</p>

<p class='c012'>I looked around in some doubt.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know, Aggie,” I returned.
“Every one appears to think a good deal
of—that sort of thing—except you—and
me. I think we shall be friends, Aggie.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thank you, Mr. Butterfield.” The grey
eyes looked into some middle distance that
I could not follow. “Caroline does look
nice,” she added, making an admission that
for some reason did not seem easy to her.
“But, of course, she’s your sister, and
brothers do not think of that. Young
brothers, I mean.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your brothers are young, then, Aggie?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes; and they say no one will ever
want to marry <i>me</i>; but that is when I
won’t be tied to a table for them to fight
about—an imprisoned princess, you know.
It doesn’t matter—now,” she added, half to
herself, and apparently forgetful of my presence.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And you don’t like—all this?” I inquired,
designating the surrounding bustle
with my hand.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” she replied in the same half-musing
tone. “<i>We</i> shouldn’t have wanted bridesmaids
and things, you know.—Of course”—she
momentarily remembered my position—“it’s
all lovely; but we should just have
gone away somewhere and not have had
anybody but perhaps a maid. We shouldn’t
have wanted anyone else, you know; and
we should have lived there ever so long.
That would have been nice.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She was scarcely talking to me; but I
replied:</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is the ideal wedding, Aggie, although
it is only for the few—there are relations
and people. I trust you will make a success
of it. I hope you will allow <i>me</i> to make
you a present, though?”</p>

<p class='c012'>She raised her head again with the same
remote look. I noticed a fine gold chain
round her neck, the end of which disappeared
in her bosom.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It won’t ever be quite the same,” she
replied. “Perhaps some day I shall have
forgotten——”</p>

<p class='c012'>I looked at the chain and spoke quietly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is that——?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” she replied, her hand going softly
to her breast. “I cut it out of a group, but
he didn’t give it to me. You don’t mind
if I don’t show it to you, do you, Mr. Butterfield?
You don’t know what it is to lose
anybody—like that.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You forget I am losing a sister, Aggie,”
I answered. She thought a moment, and
then made a sudden resolve. She spoke
softly and almost mechanically.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think I will tell you, Mr. Butterfield.
I wouldn’t tell”—she looked round—“any
one else, but—I trust you, Mr. Butterfield.
I haven’t given Caroline my present yet—I
haven’t made up my mind. I’ve got two,
a handkerchief case, and—this. I could
give her the handkerchief case—anybody
can give handkerchief cases—or the other.
Anybody wouldn’t give the other. I can’t
keep it, Mr. Butterfield. Look.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She glanced round, and drew the small
locket from her neck and opened it. It
was Bassishaw’s portrait, a poor, ragged
production, cut out, as she had said, from
some larger picture. I half glanced at it,
understanding without looking.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is worth more than a handkerchief
case,” she continued, speaking very low,
“and I know Caroline would value it more,
if I told her. If anybody did that to me I
should—I should love them. Wouldn’t
you, Mr. Butterfield?”</p>

<p class='c012'>I made no reply. Poor Aggie! She
was only sixteen, and would get over it;
but it was real to her, and she was very
brave. She went on:</p>

<p class='c012'>“And that’s why I don’t like all these
things, Mr. Butterfield. What would you
do?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Carmichael was signalling for me
across the room. I rose and took Aggie’s
hand.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My dear,” I replied, “you have a truer
instinct in these things than I. Whatever
you do will be right, I know; and a fat,
blundering man would spoil it. We sit
together at breakfast to-morrow. I’m very
glad.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And, in response to Mrs. Carmichael’s
imperious summons, I left her and plunged
again into the general bewilderment.</p>

<p class='c012'>Shortly afterwards I heard Mrs. Vicars’s
voice.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, look, Caroline, what a <i>sweet</i> handkerchief
case Agnes there has given you!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch15' class='c013'>XV <br /> <br />SETTLING DAY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Caroline was married, and with a decent
tear had left for a month’s sweet lunacy
under blue skies and on Mediterranean
terraces. I had bestowed an appropriate
valediction at Victoria Station to the accompanying
exhalation of steam, the slamming
of doors, and the waving of a green
flag, and had returned to my flat.</p>

<p class='c012'>It had not appeared quite the same to
me. I had peeped into the little room
that had been so long her own, and a sense
of emptiness and unfamiliarity had struck
me, leaving little desire to make friends
with it. My own rooms were structurally
unchanged; but a corded and labelled
trunk, left to be called for after the bridal
trip, seemed to occupy the whole place to
my utter exclusion, and unsettled me
greatly. I perceived that virtue had gone
out from these lifeless shells of apartments;
and my feline attachment to the building
itself was not sufficiently strong to reconcile
me to an immediate resumption of the old
order of things. On the whole, I did not
waste much sentiment over the matter, but
spoke a word in Mrs. Loring’s ear, received
an invitation from some friends of hers in
the country, left my chairs in canvas and
my blinds in full mourning, and made haste
to lawns and trim, clipped hedges till I
should summon resolution to face the fresh
conditions.</p>

<p class='c012'>This gave Mrs. Loring, a certain opportunity
which, as I had foreseen, she was
little likely to waive, and which also suited
my mood admirably.</p>

<p class='c012'>Overhead the rooks were holding their
sage, sustained conference, and I, I believe,
nodding gravely and judicially, when an
undefined sense of intruding mortals caused
me to blink through my lashes. Mrs. Loring
and Millicent were slowly crossing the
lawn in my direction, their white gowns
dipping from orange to grey and grey to
orange as they traversed the belts of light.
Mrs. Loring was talking; this, be it said,
was Mrs. Loring’s supreme opportunity.</p>

<p class='c012'>I had no wish to listen; it was forced on
my passive ears.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I suppose,” she was saying, “now that
Caroline’s gone, he must. I know that
Cicely Vicars told me you can do what you
like with a man who feels a little bit sorry
for himself, Millicent. <i>She did.</i>”</p>

<p class='c012'>This seemed somehow to concern me. I
had doubtless felt somewhat low, but had
no idea I had showed it so plainly as that.
Anyway, Cicely Vicars doubtless knew.
Millicent replied:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t think it’s fair, Mollie, to talk
like that. Rollo Butterfield isn’t a fool;
and I daresay Charlie Vicars isn’t such a
fool as he was—then.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Thank you, dear lady.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He isn’t a fool,” Mrs. Loring replied;
“but I do call it criminal—simply criminal—that
a man who is getting older and—fatter—every
week should keep putting off
and putting off for no reason at all except
that he’s ashamed to give in after so long.
It’s rank breach of promise. <i>I</i> know Rollo
Butterfield.”</p>

<p class='c012'>These were hard words to hear of one’s
self. Apparently Mrs. Loring’s one desire
was that that presence of mine—fat, hang
her impudence!—should hold decently together
through a marriage service, and
run to seedy corpulence immediately afterwards
for all she cared. But Millicent
vindicated me nobly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If Rollo Butterfield, Mollie, was prepared
to marry me to keep me in countenance
with all the people we know, I’d
never let him propose to me—which he
hasn’t done, by the way. But you don’t
understand him a little bit. He’s not
much fatter, my dear, saving your presence,
than Loring; and, any way, he’ll
be a young man when Loring’s—you understand
me. And you can’t say very
much more to me on the subject, Mollie.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’ll have to propose to him yourself,
then, Millie,” said Mrs. Loring, with
a worldly shrug.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I should not be afraid to do that,”
Millicent retorted defiantly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I should like to be there when it happened.”
Mrs. Loring’s tone expressed the
most offhand incredulity in the affair being
ever definitely settled. There was a
silence as they approached and discovered
my presence.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now, I had never been in the least resentful
of Mrs. Loring Chatterton’s self-arrogated
responsibility for my welfare
and Millicent’s—it had always been too
open and frank to be regarded as interference.
But in that moment she had
given me a hint that I felt half inclined
to act upon. Suppose she really were
there when it happened?</p>

<p class='c012'>I rose to meet them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Welcome, dear ladies,” I said. “You
almost caught me napping. I believe I
have been dreaming, and seemed to hear
voices.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I looked at Millicent, and thought she
understood; but it did not occur to Mrs.
Loring that I might have overheard.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You dream a good deal nowadays, Mr.
Butterfield, don’t you?” she said, somewhat
acidulously.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I fear, Mrs. Loring,” I replied, “that I
have lately done it to an extent that is
almost criminal.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She was still unenlightened, but I saw
that Millicent guessed. I made places for
them on either side of me, but Mrs. Loring
hesitated, standing. No chance is too trivial
for a matchmaker.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sit down, Mrs. Loring,” I said, making
myself comfortable just out of the sun.</p>

<p class='c012'>She sat down. I continued:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have been watching the sunset here
all alone. It is a lovely evening. You and
Loring have doubtless been sitting hand in
hand, waiting for the twilight? No? The
surroundings seem to call for that kind of
thing somehow, don’t you think?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m glad to hear you say so, Mr. Butterfield.
I have hopes of you even yet.
The evening certainly inspires such—such
things—providing they are strictly <i>en
règle</i>.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Most decidedly,” I assented; “that must
always be understood. I admit that it is
a delicate matter—that there are times
when even the most permissible caress becomes
unseasonable, just as at others an
unseasonable one is almost permissible.
But as a general rule such proceedings
must be, as you say, strictly <i>en règle</i>.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I find you in a most reasonable mood
this evening, Mr. Butterfield,” she approved,
with a glance at Millicent.
“Dreaming evidently does you good. Pray
continue.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I acknowledged her encouragement, and
went on.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It must be taken for granted, first of
all, that the endearment is a <i>bonâ fide</i> guarantee,
in which case publicity is not only
unnecessary, but impertinent. A third
person, for instance, could not possibly take
the slightest interest in it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It would be highly unbecoming,” she
assented.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Quite so,” I replied half absently; “and
that is where the kindly interest of, say,
the married chaperone fails. In the
moment that her presence becomes most
necessary, it becomes superfluous. Is not
that so?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“If you mean, Mr. Butterfield, that
I——” she said, making a movement as if
to rise.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My dear Mrs. Loring,” I replied, “we
are discussing a perfectly abstract question;
you appear to be able to deal only with a
concrete case.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then,” she retorted, “the sunset has
done you less good than I thought. An
abstract case on an evening like this!”</p>

<p class='c012'>And her eyes appeared to fill with pity
for Millicent. That lady looked up, but
said nothing.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is on such evenings, Mrs. Loring,” I
returned, “that nothing but the presence of
the chaperone divides the abstract from the
concrete.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then you <i>do</i> mean——” she said almost
impetuously.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Does it occur to you, Mrs. Loring,” I
replied, “that you are speaking with remarkable
freedom?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Loring was in a difficult position.
To stay was to nullify the opportunity, and
to postpone indefinitely (so she thought)
the consummation of her disinterested endeavours.
To leave, on the other hand, was
a hint so pointed that even she felt it might
give rise to an embarrassment that would
defeat its own ends. I pointed this out to
her—of course, in an entirely abstract way;
and Millicent, I was pleased to see, regarded
the comedy with an amused coolness that
had in it very little sympathy for Mrs.
Loring Chatterton and her methods. She
looked up laughing.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It would be rather a difficult position
for any chaperone to be placed in,” she said
mischievously. “Wouldn’t it, Mollie?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mollie was rather at a loss.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A chaperone’s is a difficult position altogether,
Millie,” she said, “and it means
considerable self-sacrifice on the part of the
one who undertakes it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is a thankless office,” I replied; “but
in the case of impetuous youth I suppose it
is necessary. Hot blood, Mrs. Loring, must
be watched.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She was getting puzzled, and evidently
losing her hold on the situation. “After
all,” she answered doubtfully, “when one
has confidence in people perhaps it doesn’t
matter so much.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is dangerous,” I warned her.
“When young recklessness takes the bit
between its teeth and plunges headlong
into a course of matrimony”—Millicent
smiled at the description as applied to ourselves—“some
calmer ruling is almost essential.
Personally, I think that at all
proposals an appointed authority should
conduct the ceremonies. One cannot
manage such affairs alone.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She didn’t quite catch the suggestion.
“It is perfectly unnecessary,” she replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Indeed?” I asked. “And suppose the
affair hung fire, and the proposal never
came at all? Imagine the sorrow of the
Goddess outside the Machine! I almost
think she has a right to insist on personal
supervision.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think you are talking a great deal of
nonsense,” she replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then, Mrs. Loring, you fail to follow
me. Take a case, say, in which the woman
proposes—I suppose you will admit the
possibility—the man might be a fool—or
dilatory—or getting fat——”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Loring Chatterton turned suddenly
on me, looked me up, down, widthwise, and
through, and found no speech. I returned
her look, and Millicent broke into unrestrained
laughter. The light that came to
the Goddess outside the Machine was too
much for her coherence.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Rollo Butterfield—and you, too, Millicent
Dixon!—Millicent—Mr. Butterfield,
how dare you, sir? You listened? I
didn’t say it!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You didn’t say—what, Mrs. Loring?”
I asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, don’t take the trouble to feign innocence!
I always thought, Mr. Butterfield—!
I never—stop laughing, Millicent,
this is not a farce—I didn’t think, Mr. Butterfield,
that you would <i>use</i>, at least, anything
you heard in so discreditable a manner!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mrs. Loring,” I answered, “I did not
listen. I was dreaming—dreaming does me
good—and I heard the rooks calling, and
several other things, quite against my will.
Besides,” I added, “if you will consider a
moment, don’t you think I was too deeply
concerned in your—friendly aspersions—not
to have some kind of right in them?
I wish to put the thing euphoniously, you
understand, Mrs. Loring, but—haven’t you
interested yourself too long in what concerns
me first of all, to take up any position
of outraged propriety now?”</p>

<p class='c012'>I awaited her reply, my eyes on her face.
I should have been sorry to fall out with
Mrs. Loring; I had had too much amusement
out of her to take her too seriously,
and I recognized that meddling was too
harsh a word for her conduct. For a full
minute she sat looking straight in front of
her, and then smiled. All was well.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m sorry for you, Millicent,” she said.
“For the first time I have doubts as to your
happiness with this—creature. I may yet
have to repent that ever I gathered you
both under my wing. Rollo Butterfield,
you think I’m laughing, but I’m not. I
haven’t forgiven you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You reserve your forgiveness, Mrs.
Loring, till no further evasion is possible.
You are still, permit me to remind you,
premature.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I looked at Millicent, whose face expressed
the greatest relish for the whole
scene. Millicent understood, and cared as
little for Mrs. Loring’s presence as I did
myself. A new recklessness took possession
of me; so long as she knew, I didn’t
give a schoolgirl’s kiss what happened.
Mrs. Loring was making uneasy motions,
and had attempted several false starts,
with the object of leaving us alone. I
took Millicent’s hand, imprisoned it in both
my own, and looked squarely at Mrs. Loring.
She sat spellbound, fascinated, a wedding
guest who could not choose but hear.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Millicent——” I said, and paused.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Rollo——” she replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Loring made another attempt to
break away.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sit in the middle, Mrs. Loring,” I said,
and we made the rearrangement. I turned
again to Millicent.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mrs. Loring says you are to propose to
me, Millicent.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mrs. Loring says you would be ashamed
to give in after so long, Rollo.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are afraid, Millicent, that I shall
say it’s sudden?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am not afraid of anything that you
will say. Or do,” she added, as I took her
hands across Mrs. Loring.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then,” I replied, “I have the honour to
ask you, Miss Dixon——”</p>

<p class='c012'>This was too much for Mrs. Loring.
She burst through our hands, and stood,
trembling, staring, lost, hysterical. Then
fled.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c012'>When the moon, a timid <i>débutante</i> in a
faint sky, rose behind the clipped boxhedge,
we were still in the arbour, Millicent
and I. One of her hands shone with
an unaccustomed jewel—it had been my
mother’s ring—and her other was in my
personal and private keeping.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I believe, Rollo,” she said, “that you
are still little more than a boy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Millicent,” I replied, “I realise less
now than ever the prospect of being grown
up. I am merely grown out—though
scarcely more so than Loring,” I added.</p>

<p class='c012'>She laughed at the recollection.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And you didn’t mind proposing to me?”
I said.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I <i>shouldn’t</i> have minded proposing to
you, Rollo, had you not——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Did I propose to you, then, Millicent?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m sure I don’t know,” she replied.
“Perhaps Mollie had her wish after all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Anyway, it didn’t make much difference.</p>
